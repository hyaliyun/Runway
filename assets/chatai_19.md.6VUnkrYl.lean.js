Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Nancy Grace was born in Macon, Georgia, the youngest of three children, to factory worker Elizabeth Grace and Mac Grace, a freight agent for Southern Railway. Her older siblings are brother Mac Jr. and sister Ginny. The Graces are longtime members of Macon's Liberty United Methodist Church, where Elizabeth plays the organ and Mac Sr. was once a Sunday School teacher. Grace graduated from Macon's Windsor Academy in 1977. In a 2011 New York Times article, David Carr wrote, \\"Since her show began in 2005, the presumption of innocence has found a willful enemy in the former prosecutor turned broadcast judge-and-jury\\". He criticized her handling of the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart, the Duke lacrosse case, the Melinda Duckett interview and suicide, and the Caylee Anthony case. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told Carr that Grace, as an attorney and reporter, \\"has managed to demean both professions with her hype, rabid persona, and sensational analysis. Some part of the public takes her seriously, and her show erodes the respect for basic rights.\\"  In January 2014, she again ignited controversy for her wildly negative depiction of recreational marijuana users. Grace made statements such as users were \\"fat and lazy\\" and that anyone who disagreed with her was \\"lethargic, sitting on the sofa, eating chips\\" to CNN's news correspondent Brooke Baldwin during a segment covering legalization in Colorado on January 6, 2014.  On October 11, 2016, The Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Show had Grace as a guest, on which they accused her of capitalizing on other's tragedy, for her personal gain. They also addressed her handling of The Ultimate Warrior's death, and the Duke lacrosse case. Norton said during the interview that he has disliked her for some time, and she has previously blocked him on Twitter. Grace, in defending herself, stated that she was a crime victim herself, and stating that they didn't ask her one decent question. The next day on The View, Grace addressed the interview, calling Norton and Roberts Beavis and Butt-Head. Grace said she had to hold back tears during the interview and stated, \\"I don't really know what it was, but it was hell for me.\\" What else happened on the show?","output":"On the show \\"The Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Show,\\" they had Nancy Grace as a guest.

Yes or no? Answer: The carotenoid beta- cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans. Question: what is vitamin a for A:","output":"Yes, the statement regarding beta-cryptoxanthin having vitamin activity in humans is correct. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays several essential roles in maintaining good health. There are two primary forms of vitamin A: preformed vitamin A (retinol) and provitamin A carotenoids, such as beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. Here are some of the primary functions of vitamin A: 1. Vision: Vitamin A is essential for maintaining healthy vision, particularly in low-light conditions. It supports the normal functioning of the retina, cornea, and other ocular tissues. 2. Immune System: Vitamin A is required for the proper functioning of the immune system, as it helps regulate the activities of various immune cells and supports the integrity of the mucosal barriers. 3. Growth and development: Vitamin A is vital for the growth of tissues and cellular differentiation, playing a crucial role in the development of organs and the maintenance of epithelial tissues, such as the skin and the linings of the eyes, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts. 4. Reproduction: Vitamin A plays a role in the development and maturation of sperm cells in males and the normal growth of the placenta in pregnant females. 5. Antioxidant activity: Some vitamin A carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, have antioxidant properties, which can help protect the body against free radical-induced oxidative damage. In summary, vitamin A is essential for various physiological functions, including maintaining healthy vision, supporting immune function, facilitating growth and development, and playing a role in reproduction. Beta-cryptoxanthin, a provitamin A carotenoid, contributes to these functions by providing some vitamin A activity in humans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Divergent plate boundaries formed within the continents to cause them to rift apart. The continents are still moving apart. The Pacific is shrinking as the Atlantic is growing. The Appalachians ( Figure below ) are now on a passive margin. The mighty mountains have weathered and eroded to what they are today.   Q: How many millions of years ago did pangaea begin breaking apart?   A: A:","output":"Pangaea began breaking apart approximately 250 million years ago. This massive supercontinent, which once encompassed all of the Earth's landmasses, started to disintegrate due to the movement of tectonic plates and the formation of divergent plate boundaries within the continents. These plate boundaries caused the continents to rift apart and initiated the continental drift that continues to this day. The ongoing process of plate tectonics is responsible for the current configuration of continents and the geological features we observe today. For instance, the Pacific Ocean is gradually shrinking, while the Atlantic Ocean is expanding. This change is due to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, which continue to shape our planet's surface. The Appalachian Mountains, situated in eastern North America, have also been significantly affected by these geological processes. These once mighty mountain ranges are now situated on a passive margin, meaning that they are no longer an active area of tectonic activity. As a result, the Appalachians have been subjected to extensive weathering and erosion, which has led to their current appearance. In summary, Pangaea began breaking apart approximately 250 million years ago. This fragmentation was caused by the formation of divergent plate boundaries within the continents and the subsequent continental drift. The ongoing movement of tectonic plates continues to shape the Earth's surface, resulting in the current arrangement of continents, the growth of the Atlantic Ocean, the shrinking of the Pacific Ocean, and the evolution of geological features such as the Appalachian Mountains."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: A British jihadi bride has taken to Twitter to warn her 'sisters' back in the UK against contacting married men in Syria and to get their own militant husbands. Aqsa Mahmood, a 'bedroom radical' who travelled to Syria earlier this year, advised women thinking of joining extremists in the Middle East 'not to be a home wrecker' in a series of Twitter posts this week. Writing under an alias, the 20-year-old invited 'sisters' to use encrypted messaging services to make contact with those waging jihad abroad, but urged them not to ask questions 'already answered' in extremist blogs. Scroll down for video. Aqsa Mahmood, a British jihadi bride who travelled to Syria earlier this year, has been tweeting advice for 'sisters' in the UK. Posting for the first time since threatening the West on the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, she wrote: ‘Sisters please for the sake of Allah contact the sisters whom [sic] are online. 'Also know the fact many brothers whom you contact and chat to are married. Have some self respect and don't be a homewrecker.' The messages come after a string of threats against the West were detailed in an online diary by the former student. As well as warning against contacting the husbands of female extremists, she told would-be militants to 'pack thermal clothing' if they intend to travel to Syria, where the winters are 'too much'. 'Bun (forget) Scotland, the winters here are too much. Sisters please don't forget to pack thermal clothing or you'll regret it later on,' she wrote. She also hinted at her whereabouts, making reference to the Syrian town of Manbij, north east of Aleppo. The 20-year-old posted a series of tweets from a Twitter account offering other female jihadists advice. The former student also referred to a horse in the Syrian town of Manbij and tweeted this photograph. Today a spokesman for the 20-year-old's family said the posts were 'torturing' her parents. 'The family are aware of recent tweets. The best advice they could offer Aqsa is to not to offer any advice to young Muslims to whom she is essentially offering a death sentence,' Aemar Anwar, the family's lawyer, said. 'It's an extremely painful (situation) of mixed emotions - of extreme anger that their daughter has shamed them and shamed the community of Scotland. 'She has joined a cult that murders and tortures innocents. Yet again she's out there tweeting, attempting to take other children from their families. 'It's extremely difficult for her parents, not knowing whether she's dead or alive, wondering whether she will ever return home safely and added to that is the anger and shame at what she continues to do. 'What she claims to do in the name of Islam doesn't match with any of the values they taught her. A spokesman for the girl's parents Muzaffar and Khalida Mahmood said Aqsa's continued messages is 'torturing' the couple who are trying 'to move on with their lives' 'It's daily torture for them worrying about her yet having to get on with their lives. They have three other children to think about. 'She's gone now, but there's still this constant drip from Aqsa.' Mr Anwar added while her parents would still welcome the youngster back to the UK, the window of opportunity for her safe return is narrowing. 'She'll either be killed there by a drone or another militia. Or she can come home. 'We publically stated that every case should be treated on a case by case basis, and it may well be the situation that the authorities will want to speak to her. 'But if she was to face criminal sanctions it would be much better than what is likely a death sentence in Syria. Mahmood has not been seen by her family since fleeing their Glasgow home last November. In February, the former private schoolgirl married an extremist and began chronicling her life in the Middle East in a series of blog and Twitter posts. A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'Enquiries are continuing into this matter.'

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the world's longest type of venomous snake????","output":"The world's longest venomous snake is the King Cobra, scientifically known as Ophiophagus Hannah. Its name \\"Ophiophagus\\" is derived from Greek, bits of which translate to \\"snake-eating,\\" which is reflective of its dietary habits. This species highly prefers to feed on other snakes, and occasionally, it can eat lizards or rodents.  The King Cobra is native to the rainforests and plains of India, Southern China, and Southeast Asia. Notably observed in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia amongst other countries, they often occupy dense highland forests.  King Cobras are quite impressive in size. On average, they typically measure between 10 to 13 feet (3-4 meters) in length, and can reach weights from 6 to 20 lbs (3-9 kgs). However, the longest known specimen in captivity, named \\"Crunch,\\" a resident at the Crystal Palace Aquarium in England, measured 5.85 meters, or approximately 19.2 feet. In the wild, the largest accurately measured King Cobra was 5.59 meters or 18.3 feet in length. The King Cobra's venom is a potent cocktail of neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, and other compounds which can cause paralysis and death in its prey. When threatened or cornered, this species is known to raise up to a third of its body off the ground, flatten its neck ribs into a 'hood', and growl menacingly. Despite their intimidating demeanor and potent venom, they tend to avoid humans and typically only attack when cornered or when a female's eggs are threatened. Despite being the longest venomous snake, it's worth mentioning, they are not the most venomous. That title goes to the Inland Taipan, a snake native to Australia whose venom is far more toxic compared to King Cobra. Irrespective of the toxicity, an untreated King Cobra bite is very deadly to humans. Unfortunately, King Cobras are currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Deforestation, loss of habitat, and value on the black market have all contributed to a decrease in King Cobra population. Some countries such as India have deemed this majestic creature as a protected species. In cultural aspects, particularly in India, the King Cobra has significant roles in local myths and is also a staple in various snake charmer performances. Additionally, the King Cobra is recognized in the logo for the famous car manufacturer, Shelby, indicating speed, power and grace.    In conclusion, the King Cobra is the world's longest type of venomous snake, fascinating and often terrifying due to its great size, venom potency, and striking appearance. Their ecological role is invaluable as they help control populations of other snakes, thereby keeping the ecosystem balanced."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you need to answer 'Yes' if the given word is the longest word (in terms of number of letters) in the given sentence, else answer 'No'.

There are several elements in the premise that indicate the falsity of the hypothesis: 1. \\"A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in\\": This phrase clearly highlights that there was at least one child who applied but was not accepted. The father's disappointment reflects that not every child was accepted into the program. 2. \\"Only VIP brats had been accepted\\": The father's statement implies that there may have been a bias in the selection process, favoring children from privileged backgrounds or with influential connections. This suggests that not every applicant was given equal opportunity or consideration. 3. \\"Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC\\": The fact that Furtok's child got into the program, and the reaction he had to the father's statement (hitting the father in the face), indicates that the acceptance process might not have been entirely fair and transparent.

Dünya Savaşı'nın yıldönümünde, Yunanlılar yine \\"Hayır\\" dedi Translate to English","output":"\\"On the anniversary of World War II, the Greeks said 'No' again\\" The phrase you shared is in Turkish and based on its direct translation, it refers to a specific historical event from World War II where Greeks took a strong stance. On October 28, 1940, during the onset of the World War II, Italy presented an ultimatum to Greece, essentially demanding its surrender. Greece's response was a decisive \\"No\\" (or \\"Oxi\\" in Greek). This is remembered and celebrated annually in Greece as \\"Oxi Day\\". The phrase implies a commemoration of this historical event, remembering the courage and the resistance demonstrated by the Greeks during the war. Furthermore, the \\"No\\" mentioned may be metaphorical or literal, referring to Greeks taking a similar stance against a current situation or event. It may be mentioning a continued Greek spirit of resistance or defiance on the anniversary of the war. It could refer to any situation where Greeks are saying \\"No\\" again. It depends on the context in which it is being said. It could be related to politics, economics, social issues etc. To completely understand what the \\"No\\" is referring to, a wider context is needed. Without additional context it's unclear what the Greeks are saying \\"No\\" to in the current situation. The writer might reference an event or action that took place on a World War II anniversary where Greeks, as a nation or government, refused or declined something, echoing the historical \\"No\\" of 1940. Whether it is a local event, a governmental decision, a political stance, or an international event, the underlying notion is that the Greeks are displaying a resistance or defiance similar to their World War II response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: Information:  - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.  - Marvel Comics is the common name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, an American publisher of comic books and related media.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Instructions: Given a scientific question and its correct answer, generate supporting facts for the answer. This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Input: Question: What is the term for the process in which two atomic nuclei fuse together to make a single nucleus? Answer: fusion Output:","output":"Fusion is a nuclear reaction where two atomic nuclei combine to create a single, more massive nucleus. The supporting facts for this process are: 1. Energy release: During fusion, a significant amount of energy is released due to the conversion of a small portion of the mass of the reactant nuclei into energy, according to Einstein's famous equation E=mc². This energy release is mainly in the form of kinetic energy and radiation. 2. High temperatures and pressures: The conditions required for fusion to occur include extremely high temperatures (millions of degrees Celsius) and pressures. These conditions allow the atomic nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between their positively charged protons and get close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together. 3. Occurrence in stars: Fusion is the primary process responsible for energy production in stars, like our Sun. In stars, hydrogen nuclei (protons) merge to form helium nuclei through a series of fusion reactions called the proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle. These fusion reactions produce energy in the form of light and heat, which is emitted from the star's surface. 4. Fusion isotopes: The most common and well-studied fusion reaction on Earth involves the isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium (D) and tritium (T). When deuterium and tritium nuclei fuse, they create a helium nucleus, a free neutron, and release a substantial amount of energy. This is known as D-T fusion. 5. Fusion power: Scientists and engineers have long been exploring ways to harness the energy produced by fusion reactions for power generation on Earth. Fusion power has the potential to provide a nearly limitless, clean and sustainable source of energy. Experimental devices such as tokamaks and stellarators have been developed to contain and control fusion reactions using magnetic fields. In summary, fusion is the process where two atomic nuclei combine to create a single, heavier nucleus. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy and occurs in extreme conditions typically found in stars. Harnessing fusion reactions for energy production on Earth remains an ongoing and promising area of research."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a context paragraph, a question based on that and corresponding answer of a question.

Output:","output":"We can solve this problem by determining how long it takes for Maxwell and Brad to meet, then use this time to find how far Brad travels. Step 1: Since both of them are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds. This will be 4 km/h (Maxwell's speed) + 6 km/h (Brad's speed) = 10 km/h. Step 2: Next, we need to find out how long it takes for them to meet each other. Because they are moving towards each other, we divide the total distance by their relative speed. Therefore, the time it takes them to meet is 70 km (the total distance) divided by 10 km/h = 7 hours. Step 3: Brad's travel distance will be his speed multiplied by the time it took for them to meet. So Brad travels 6 km/h (his speed) * 7 hours = 42 kilometers.  Therefore, the distance traveled by Brad is 42 kilometers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on learning the various texts. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. Buddhist scriptures are mainly written in Pāli, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Chinese. Some texts still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The landlocked country of Mongolia would most likely read Buddhist scriptures in the Mongolian language. As mentioned in the context, Buddhist scriptures and texts exist in various languages, primarily Pāli, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Chinese. Some texts still exist in Sanskrit and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. The preference for the language of the scriptures often depends on the region and the specific schools of Buddhism practiced there. Mongolia has a rich history of Buddhism, primarily associated with Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism. However, since the 13th century, Mongolian translations of Tibetan Buddhist texts have been produced, and the process has continued throughout the centuries. These texts cover various aspects of Buddhism, including philosophy, rituals, and meditation practices. The Mongolian language and script were initially developed under the influence of the Uyghur script, incorporating some elements of Tibetan, Chinese, and other regional scripts. In Mongolia, due to the historical connection with Tibet and the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Tibetan Buddhist canon - composed of the Kangyur (translated words of the Buddha) and the Tengyur (commentaries by Indian and Tibetan masters) - has been particularly influential. When the process of translating Tibetan Buddhist texts into the Mongolian language began, it adapted to the needs and cultural context of the region. As a result, many Mongolian translations of Tibetan Buddhist texts exist today, reflecting the importance of Buddhism in the history and culture of Mongolia. These translated texts also contain unique features and adaptations that make them distinctly Mongolian, preserving the cultural heritage of the country. Therefore, considering the deep-rooted history of Buddhism in Mongolia, the strong influence of Tibetan Buddhism, and the availability of Buddhist texts translated into the Mongolian language, it is most likely that Buddhists in Mongolia would read scriptures in the Mongolian language. Doing so not only allows them to engage in religious practices more readily but also preserves the nation's rich linguistic and cultural heritage."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Research by the Institute of Education (IOE) in London found that men who went to single-sex schools were not only more likely to be separated from a partner or divorced, but also more likely to be depressed by middle age. The chances of women having successful marriages were not affected by whether they were educated in mixed or single-sex schools.Separate research by the IOE found that going without boys was beneficial for women in other ways since there was a \\" statistically significant positive association between single-sex schooling and wages for women\\". The study into marital success interviewed 17,000 adults who were taught in a range of schools including private boarding schools to state comprehensives.It found that single-sex education does not compromise the chances either of men or women of getting married. However, researchers found that boys educated on their own were more likely to divorce in later life.While for women, there was no significant link.The research also found men taught in boys' schools were more likely to suffer from depression by age 42--perhaps because of their increased chances of marital breakdown.But Professor Leonard's team was unable to identify why those men educated in a single-sex environment were more likely to divorce. The study asked married and  _ g couples where men had attended both single-sex and mixed schools to rate how happy they were and found no marked difference in their happiness levels or willingness to share domestic chores. Mary Boust, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the IOE research confirmed what was always suspected.\\"All the research shows single-sex schools are good for girls but bad for boys--both in terms of academic performance and socialization,\\" she said.\\"Boys learn better when they are with girls and they actually learn to get on better.\\" The findings were presented at a conference on gender in education hosted by Perse School for Girls in Cambridge.

Question: With whom did the Soviet command arrange a deal to hold action against withdrawing Soviet troops? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Afghan Breakdown Context: The events unfold just before the start of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1988. Lieutenant Steklov, son of a high-ranking General, is assigned to Afghanistan, hoping to take part in combat and earn some medals before the war ends. Sgt. Arsionov (Aleksei Serebryakov) combines his combat experience and bravery with brutal hazing of young conscripts back on the field base. Major Bandura\`s tour of duty has expired. He is free to go home and reunite with his wife whom he has almost forgot. This means leaving his mistress Katya (Tatyana Dogileva), a nurse in the base's hospitalâto a much anticipation from Bandura's superior Leonid (Mikhail Zhygalov) who fell in love with Katya. Anxiety is felt by many characters about the change taking place back in the Soviet Union during the Perestroika. Bandura himself thinks he might not be able to adapt. Katya says that Afghanistan will be remembered as the best part of their lives. The Soviet command arranges a deal with a local Afghan warlord that he won't take action against the withdrawing Soviet troops in exchange for weapons and supplies. When asked why he needs more weapons as the war seems to be coming to an end, he replies that his war will go on for a very long time. On its way back to base the convoy that has delivered the supplies is ambushed by another faction of the mujahedin. The paratroopers take cover and fight back with only a few casualties, but the road is blocked by a damaged fuel tanker. While Bandura personally drives a tank to push the tanker off the road, inexperienced Steklov dashes forward attempting to lead troops to counterattack and is badly wounded. Later, his leg is amputated at the hospital, which adds to the stack of Bandura's career problems. Bandura decides to stay with his men for a while and lead a retaliatory mission to finish a mujahedin leader, who is presumed wounded and taken to the neutral warlord's village. When the preparations are finished, Bandura comes to say good bye to Katya, who is scheduled to leave the country...

Barcelona's leading scorers doubtful for match against Inter at Nou Camp. Defeat to Jose Mourinho's men could see Barcelona eliminated.","output":"Title: Barcelona's Road to Victory: High Stakes and Uncertain Futures for Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic Introduction Barcelona's iconic Nou Camp will soon bear witness to a significant match against Inter Milan, one that could alter the course of the 2021-2022 season. With the daunting prospect of facing Jose Mourinho's formidable squad, the Catalan giants are sweating over the fitness levels of their leading scorers: Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. With both stars' participation currently shrouded in doubt, their absence could open up avenues for the opposition, thereby putting the risk of a potential elimination on the horizon. The Importance of Messi and Ibrahimovic It is no secret that the partnership between Messi and Ibrahimovic in the frontline has been instrumental in shaping the success of Barcelona in recent years. Playing alongside each other, these exceptional athletes have forged a symbiotic relationship characterized by precision, agility, and uncanny coordination; not to mention, an unparalleled ability to transform seemingly innocuous plays into awe-inspiring goals.  Thus, despite having a star-studded lineup packed with talented players, the potential absence of this powerful duo casts an ominous shadow on Barcelona's chances at victory. The question remains: can the team fend off the challenge by Mourinho's men? Mourinho's Strategies and Inter Milan's Threat Jose Mourinho is a master tactician, with a penchant for identifying and exploiting his opponent's weaknesses. In the lead-up to the match at Nou Camp, it is expected that the former Manchester United and Chelsea coach will emphasize the fragile state of his rival's frontline. Armed with such knowledge, Mourinho's Inter Milan squad, featuring the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martínez, can launch relentless attacks and create defensive chaos. Moreover, Inter Milan has consistently exhibited solid defensive capabilities and tactical flexibility, characteristics that have posed challenges for even the most formidable opponents. Consequently, if Barcelona lacks the prowess of Messi and Ibrahimovic, they are forced to compete on an uneven playing field and increase their chances of elimination. The Prospects for Barcelona Given the sheer importance of the upcoming match and the uncertainty surrounding their leading stars' fitness levels, Barcelona's coaching staff is undoubtedly working tirelessly to find alternative solutions. The adaptability of a team to perform under pressure while facing major setbacks can indeed alter the course of a season. For Barcelona, this could mean relying on the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Ansu Fati to fulfill the offensive void potentially left by the injured duo. Both players have showcased their talent in the past, and the critical situation could drive them to greatness on the field. In terms of tactical adjustments, manager Ronald Koeman might consider adopting a more cautious approach, maintaining a solid defensive structure while relying on counterattacks as the primary offensive weapon. This tactic could mitigate Inter's expected aggressive stance and provide Barcelona some much-needed breathing space. Conclusion As the suspense regarding the fitness of Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic continues to build, it is inevitable that the outcome of the match against Inter Milan carries vast implications. Should Barcelona emerge victorious despite the absence of their star players, the narrative stands to shift: the Catalan giants will have proven their resilience in the face of adversity, using the momentum to catapult themselves forward. On the other hand, a defeat would ignite questions and doubts; yet, at the same time, it would provide an opportunity for self-reflection and growth. Whether or not Messi and Ibrahimovic take the field at Nou Camp against Mourinho's men, it remains clear that the match will create an unforgettable chapter in the sport's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Starring Timothy Olyphant, Stephen Eric McIntyre, Joe Anderson and Rossif Sutherland, \\"High Life\\" is a comedic heist movie from the flip-side of the '80s consumer dream. Hypothesis: High Life features criminal characters","output":"After analyzing the information provided in the paragraph about the 2009 Canadian film \\"High Life,\\" describing it as a comedic heist movie and considering that it is adapted from a stage play by Lee MacDougall, it is possible to come to a conclusion about the hypothesis that the film features criminal characters. A heist movie, by definition, often includes stories about planned robberies, thefts, or other forms of illegal activities. These movies involve characters who conspire to commit the crime, showcasing the planning process and the execution of the heist. In addition, these films often feature tension arising from the interaction between the characters as well as the challenges and consequences they face during and after their criminal endeavor. As \\"High Life\\" is explicitly stated to be a comedic heist movie, it is reasonable to assume that it would feature characters who are involved in some form of criminal activity. It is important to also consider that the story takes place on the \\"flip-side of the '80s consumer dream,\\" which might imply that the characters could be engaging in crime as a means to either attain a better life or to satire the era's materialistic ideals. Taking the description and context of the movie into account, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true: \\"High Life\\" indeed features criminal characters who participate in various illegal activities, as shown from the film being described as a comedic heist movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? The Mexican Senate has just passed, 72-2, an 8% tax on candy, chips and other high-calorie foods. It continues to debate a special additional tax of about 8 cents per liter on sugary soda. You can understand why Mexican leaders are worried about their nation's eating habits. Mexicans consume more sugary soft drinks per person than any other people on earth. Mexico suffers the highest incidence of diabetes among the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Mexicans are more likely to be obese even than Americans, the next runner-up. Taxes on junk foods constitute just a part of a vast fiscal reform proposed by Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.

This ear scratching is because ear mites can cause considerable irritation. The rabbit may scratch his ears with his paw or rub his ears on the ground.  Your rabbit may also shake his head or hold his ear over to one side. Your rabbit’s ears may have reddened or inflamed skin. Irritation from the feces and saliva of the mite causes extreme itchiness, and the rabbit scratches and traumatizes the ear. A severe infection due to ear mites is characterized by distinctive yellow-gray debris and scale that builds up and fills the ear canal. This debris and discharge is tightly adhered to the skin. Attempting to remove the debris causes pain.  Forcible removal tends to peel away the top layer of skin with the discharge leaving a large ulcer behind. Typically in the early stages of infection, close inspection may show scales of skin tightly stuck to the ear canal. If ear mites are left untreated, the weight of the collected debris inside the ear can cause it to drop. The rabbit may develop secondary bacterial infections where the skin is damaged, and infection may spread inwards into the middle and inner ear causing poor balance and a head tilt.","output":"This article discusses the symptoms and consequences of ear mite infections in rabbits, highlighting common signs such as ear scratching, head shaking, and inflamed skin, while stressing the importance of timely treatment to prevent complications like secondary bacterial infections and balance issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Thirty years old and single, Pauline \\"Poppy\\" Cross shares a London flat with her best friend Zoe, a fellow teacher. Poppy is free-minded, high-spirited and kind-hearted. The film opens with Poppy trying to engage a shop employee in conversation. He ignores her, yet his icy demeanour does not bother her. She maintains her good mood even when she discovers her bicycle has been stolen. Her main concern is not getting a new one or finding the bicycle, but that she did not get a chance to say goodbye to it. This prompts her to decide to learn how to drive. When Poppy takes driving lessons for the first time, her positive attitude contrasts starkly with her gloomy, intolerant and cynical driving instructor, Scott. He is emotionally repressed, has anger problems and becomes extremely agitated by Poppy's casual attitude towards driving. As Poppy gets to know him, it becomes evident that Scott believes in conspiracy theories. His beliefs are partly attributable to his racist and misogynistic views, which make it hard for him to get along with others. Scott seems to be angered by Poppy's sunny personality and what he perceives as a lack of responsibility and concern for driving safety. Scott is exceptionally irritated by Poppy's choice of footwear (a pair of high-heeled boots), which he feels compromises her ability to drive. From the outset, he feels Poppy does not take her lessons seriously and is careless. Poppy, however, does have the capacity to be responsible. At school, Poppy observes one of her pupils bullying one of his classmates. Rather than becoming angry, she worries about him and takes the appropriate action. After speaking with her student, she comes to the correct conclusion that her student is being abused at home. A social worker, Tim, is brought in to handle the boy's case. Through Tim and the pupil's interactions, the latter reveals that his mother's boyfriend has been beating him. Tim and Poppy begin dating.  Guess a valid title for it!

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A rising population is one of the main reasons that there is global warming. Between 1650 and 1850 the population increased by 0.75 billion people going from 0.25 billion to one billion. From 1930 to the end of the century the population rose from two billion to over six billion. In just a third of the time the population rose by more than five times what it did before. It is expected that this trend in the changing population will continue and could even heighten. The growing population requires increasing amounts of energy. These energy demands and other supplies require production, which almost always involves the emission of greenhouse gases. The more the population increases the more greenhouse gases that are produced and the greater the increase in temperature. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the best-known causes for global warming. The major reason for fossil fuels contributing so much to global warming is the release of carbon that occurs during the burning of fossil fuels. When people burn fossil fuels, they release large amounts of carbon by way of the release of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide in the air then leads to global warming. Another source of carbon dioxide comes from _ . In forests there is a large amount of carbon that is stored in the trees and other plants. This carbon is out of the atmosphere because the trees consume the carbon from carbon dioxide. When people cut down trees, they are frequently burned. This burning releases the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that was stored in organic matter. Even when new trees are planted, it can take up to one hundred years to make up for the carbon that was released. It is commonly thought that because trees absorb more carbon dioxide, the atmosphere experiences positive effects.

Input: Abstract: CONTEXT Whether immunosuppressive treatment adversely affects survival is unclear.     OBJECTIVE To assess whether immunosuppressive drugs increase mortality.     DESIGN Retrospective cohort study evaluating overall and cancer mortality in relation to immunosuppressive drug exposure among patients with ocular inflammatory diseases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data derived from medical records, and mortality results from United States National Death Index linkage. The cohort's mortality risk was compared with US vital statistics using standardised mortality ratios. Overall and cancer mortality in relation to use or non-use of immunosuppressive drugs within the cohort was studied with survival analysis.     SETTING Five tertiary ocular inflammation clinics. Patients 7957 US residents with non-infectious ocular inflammation, 2340 of whom received immunosuppressive drugs during follow up. Exposures Use of antimetabolites, T cell inhibitors, alkylating agents, and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors.     MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Overall mortality, cancer mortality.     RESULTS Over 66 802 person years (17 316 after exposure to immunosuppressive drugs), 936 patients died (1.4/100 person years), 230 (24.6%) from cancer. For patients unexposed to immunosuppressive treatment, risks of death overall (standardised mortality ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 1.11) and from cancer (1.10, 0.93 to 1.29) were similar to those of the US population. Patients who used azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, systemic corticosteroids, or dapsone had overall and cancer mortality similar to that of patients who never took immunosuppressive drugs. In patients who used cyclophosphamide, overall mortality was not increased and cancer mortality was non-significantly increased. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were associated with increased overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.99, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.98) and cancer mortality (adjusted HR 3.83, 1.13 to 13.01).     CONCLUSIONS Most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs do not seem to increase overall or cancer mortality.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Eye contact, a channel of kinesics, is the primary way that people communicate dominance. People establishing dominance will take the liberty of staring at and surveying others while making direct eye contact. They will also be the last person to break eye contact. If you're looking to assert your power, keep in mind that constant eye contact can be intimidating. A person asserting dominance will also refrain from smiling in order to communicate seriousness and may instead frown or purse his lips. Gestures can display dominance; pointing at others and using large gestures is a way to show others your status. In addition, when someone takes a wider and taller stance while also being relaxed, this is another show of dominance. Dominant individuals will also have a firm handshake. They will usually place their hand on top with their palm facing downwards; the grip will be firm and sustained in order to demonstrate control. Those with high status will generally enable more physical space to exist between themselves and lower status people. High-status individuals will also take up more physical space to show their dominance and mastery of the situation. In other words, an expansive pose signals power and achievement.  Power is also displayed through standing versus sitting. Standing - and particularly in the foreground - is seen as a more powerful pose.  A straight back and strong shoulders kept back, rather than hunching forward, further conveys confidence. Slouching and slumping, by contrast, convey a lack of confidence.  Dominant individuals will also lead from the front and walk ahead of the group or go through the doors first. They like to be up front. People asserting their status will have more options when it comes to touch because they feel more confident in their position. Generally, in an unequal situation where one person has a higher status, he will touch the lower-status person with greater frequency. In social situations where both communicators have equal status, both people will reciprocate touch in similar ways. Summary:","output":"This article highlights how dominance is communicated through eye contact, gestures, body language, physical space, posture, leading positions, and touch, all of which convey power, confidence, and status in various social situations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we are going to talk about something very important: our health! Health is a big word that means how well our bodies are working. To stay healthy, we need to understand a few things about ourselves. 1. Age, Gender, and Ethnicity First, let's think about who we are. We all have different ages, like how old you are when you celebrate your birthday. Our gender is if we are a boy or a girl. And, our ethnicity tells us about where we come from and the different traditions we have. All these things can affect our health. For example, some sicknesses happen more to older people, and others more to kids. Boys and girls might have different health problems too. And sometimes, people from different places might have different health issues. 2. Evaluate Your Lifestyle Lifestyle means the things that we do every day — like how much we play, sleep, study, and eat. Being active is very important, like running on the playground or playing sports. But sometimes, we need to slow down, take a nap, or get a good night's sleep. It's also important to eat healthy food, like fruits, vegetables, and yummy snacks that give us energy. A healthy lifestyle is like having a superpower that keeps us strong and not get sick easily! 3. Know Your Personal and Family Medical History Sometimes, we might have a sickness because it runs in our family. This means people in our family had the same sickness before — like our mom, dad, brothers or sisters, even our grandmas and grandpas. It is good to know about these things because it helps us take better care of ourselves. 4. Talk to Your Doctor Doctors are our friends who help us stay healthy. Just like how we talk to our friends and parents about our day, we can share with the doctors anything we feel about our health. We should tell the doctor if we are feeling sick or something is different, even if it seems small. The doctors will listen to us, ask questions, and maybe even do some tests. They help us understand what is happening and treat our health problems. Oh, and remember — always tell a grown-up if you are feeling sick or need to see the doctor. They care about us and will be there to help! So, friends, that's it! It's important to know about our age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, and family history, and talk to our doctor to understand our health.

Article: President Obama remarks on the situation with admitted NSA leaker Edward Snowden, saying he has no plans to disrupt relations with Russia and China, nor to scramble jets to capture the \\"29-year-old hacker.\\"      President Obama said he should not have to speak personally with the leaders of Russia and China regarding self-professed NSA leaker Edward Snowden, and said he was “not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker” during a press conference in Senegal on Thursday.      The president was on the first leg of a trip to Africa when he struck the seemingly dismissive tone regarding the former defense contractor who claimed to have leaked details of two top-secret government data-gathering programs before initiating an international manhunt that has grown to involve the governments of China, Ecuador, and Russia.      Obama said that the revelations first published in British newspaper The Guardian and The Washington Post – and the ensuing search for Snowden, who has been charged with theft of government property and two offenses of espionage statutes – have the makings of a big-screen spy caper, but that he would not engage in “wheeling and dealing and trading and a whole host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited so he can face the justice system here in the United States.”      Snowden, 30, is believed to still be hiding at a Moscow airport awaiting a ruling on his request for asylum from the government of Ecuador. Snowden flew to Russia from Hong Kong over the weekend but has not been seen since his arrival. Russian officials told Reuters that he remains in a transit area at Sheremetyevo airport.      He was not aboard an Aeroflot flight that departed Moscow to Havana on Thursday, the first stop on an anticipated escape route to the South American country.      “Now I get why it’s a fascinating story from a press perspective and I’m sure there will be a made-for-TV movie somewhere down the line,” Obama said, adding that “in terms of U.S. interests, the damage was done with respect to the initial leaks.”      Dolores Ochoa / AP A man reads a newspaper with the Spanish headline \\"Snowden stuck at Moscow airport\\" in Quito, Ecuador, on Wednesday.      Snowden’s case resolved “some pretty significant vulnerabilities” at the National Security Agency, Obama said. Snowden worked for defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton before being fired, and said in an interview with the South China Morning Post that he took the job to gain access to sensitive information. NBC News could not independently verify the report.      “There have been some useful conversations that have taken place between the United States government and the Russian government,” Obama said. “And my continued expectation is that Russia – there are other countries that have talked about potentially providing Mr. Snowden asylum – recognize that they are part of an international community and that they should be abiding by international law.”      The U.S. is worried that Snowden might have other documents in his possession that he may “dribble out,” Obama said.      “I continue to be concerned about the other documents that he may have. That’s part of the reason why we’d like to have Mr. Snowden in custody,” Obama said. “But what I think we’re going to continue to do is make sure that we are following the various channels that are well established and the rules that are well established to get this thing done.”      Ecuador’s communications minister said on Thursday that his country renounced hundreds of millions of dollars in trade tariff benefits, the Associated Press reported. Communications Minister Fernando Alvarez said the trade benefits being considered for renewal by U.S. lawmakers had become an “instrument of blackmail” as the country considered granting asylum to Snowden.      Ecuador “does not accept threats from anybody, and does not trade in principles, or submit to mercantile interests, as important as they may be,” Alvarez said, according to the AP.      In Washington, the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has threatened to lead the effort to remove preferential trade treatment for Ecuadorian goods if the country decides to offer asylum to Snowden.      \\"Edward Snowden is a fugitive who has endangered the national security of the United States,\\" Sen. Robert Menendez said in a statement released late on Wednesday. \\"Trade preferences are a privilege granted to nations, not a right. I urge [Ecuadorean] President Correa to do the right thing by the United States and Ecuador, and deny Snowden's request for asylum.\\"      Hours later, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman told reporters the administration had accepted an industry petition to consider revoking Ecuador's benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences program. That petition actually pre-dates current tension between the two countries over Snowden.      In 2012, Ecuador exported some 5.4 billion worth of oil, 166 million of cut flowers, 122 million of fruits and vegetables and 80 million of tuna to the United States.      Menendez said he would lead efforts to stop the renewal of Ecuador's duty-free access to America markets under the Generalized System of Preferences program, which expires on July 31. He also said he'd try and block renewal of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, which also expires at the end of July.      The ongoing incident has also heightened tensions with China, as the country’s defense minister said that the U.S. Internet monitoring program revealed in documents leaked by Snowden “has revealed the concerned country’s true face and hypocritical behavior.” Defense ministry spokesman Yang Yujun did not explicitly name the United States in his comments, Reuters reported.      Also on Thursday, a government official in Switzerland said the country still has questions about Snowden's time working in Geneva as a CIA operative, Reuters reported. Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter said they received a \\"diplomatic\\" response from the U.S. to questions about Snowden's time in the country from 2007 and 2009, but \\"have decided to discuss these points further in the future with the Americans.\\"      NBC News' Ghazi Balkiz and Reuters contributed to this report.      Related:      This story was originally published on ||||| His remarks on Mr. Snowden’s case followed similarly toned-down language by his aides on the severity of the problem, reflecting efforts by the administration to smooth relations with Russia and China. Earlier in the day, China’s Defense Ministry accused the administration of hypocrisy, using Mr. Snowden’s disclosures about American surveillance abroad as evidence that China is a victim, not a perpetrator, of cyberspying and hacking.      Mr. Snowden’s disclosures have embarrassed the administration and raised debate about the government’s invasion of privacy. Mr. Snowden and his supporters, including WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group, have called him a whistle-blower and a hero. Federal prosecutors have charged him with violating espionage laws, and some American legislators have called him a traitor.      Ecuador, which is protecting Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, at its London embassy, has confirmed that Mr. Snowden has requested asylum and has suggested that his human rights could be violated if he were returned to the United States. But Ecuador, which had said it could take months to evaluate the asylum request, suggested Thursday that all the attention focused on its decision was misplaced.      Photo      “Mr. Snowden is not in Ecuadorean territory and to process an asylum request that is what is required,” the country’s president, Rafael Correa, said during a news conference on Thursday in Quevedo, in western Ecuador. “We received the asylum request, we have studied it and that is precisely the first conclusion, that to process it to finally approve it or deny it he must be in Ecuadorean territory.”      Asked if he had considered bringing Mr. Snowden to Ecuador or to one of his country’s embassies, he said, “No.”      Mr. Correa also disputed assertions made earlier in the week by Mr. Assange and others that Mr. Snowden had been given travel documents by Ecuador that assured him safe passage to the country.      “The government has not authorized any safe-conduct or refugee permit for Mr. Snowden,” Mr. Correa said. Referring to a safe-conduct document that appeared to have been issued by Ecuador’s embassy in London, he said that if it turned out to be authentic, “whoever issued it is totally without authority.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Saying they would not bow to threats, officials in Ecuador also announced that they were unilaterally renouncing preferential trade privileges given to the country by the United States. Those privileges, which apply to Ecuadorean exports worth hundreds of millions of dollars, were to expire at the end of July, and were unlikely to be renewed by Congress because of the strained relationship between the two countries. Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned Ecuador on Wednesday that its “trade preferences could be revoked” if it granted Mr. Snowden’s asylum request.      Photo      Russian officials have said they consider Mr. Snowden a free man and have hinted that they were pressuring him to leave. President Vladimir V. Putin said Tuesday that “the sooner he chooses his final destination, the better for us and for him.”      Whether he is feeling pressure to leave is unclear: a Russian immigration official close to the situation said that Mr. Snowden was entitled to stay in the airport as long as he wanted, even though he has not asked for a Russian visa or received one.      An extended stay in Russia would seem to narrow Mr. Snowden’s options, allowing American officials to dangle carrots and sticks before countries like Ecuador and Venezuela that are considering granting him asylum.      A buzz of suspense surrounded Flight 150 to Havana on Thursday at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow, with expectations that Mr. Snowden would be a passenger.      But no unusual security measures were visible as passengers boarded the flight, with two dozen reporters and photographers pressed against the terminal window as the plane backed away from the gate. Journalists from Reuters and ABC, who had booked tickets in hopes of interviewing Mr. Snowden, said it appeared that he was not on board. ||||| How Snowden was identified as Ars user TheTrueHOOHA      June 5, 2013      The Guardian and The Washington Post begin publishing top secret leaked NSA documents.      June 9      Edward Snowden reveals he's the leaker.      June 12, early afternoon      Reuters publishes a profile indicating that Snowden used to use the online username \\"The True HOOHA.\\"      June 12, afternoon      Anthony DeRosa publishes an article noting that hundreds of posts were written on Ars Technica forums by a user named TheTrueHOOHA, with many biographical details that line up with Snowden.      June 12, Later afernoon      Business Insider and Buzzfeed both publish articles confirming that TheTrueHOOHA is Snowden, noting that he published photos of himself on Ars and elsewhere.      June 12, 8:33pm EST      Ars Technica reviews Snowden posts and publishes an article about Snowden's \\"life on Ars.\\"      June 13-21      NY Times, LA Times, Washington Post, many others write about Snowden's activity on Ars.            Ed Snowden was 23 years old when he moved to Geneva in 2007. Soon after arriving, he was looking for a taste of home.      It wasn't that he was unhappy. Snowden's life was becoming the adventure he'd been looking for. Moving to Switzerland hadn't been his first choice—his dream picks were in Asia and Australia—but it certainly wasn't bad. Hired by the CIA and granted a diplomatic cover, he was a regular old IT guy whose life was elevated by a hint of international intrigue.      Snowden would soon move into a four-bedroom apartment covered by the agency. He'd blow off parking tickets, citing diplomatic immunity. He'd travel the continent. He befriended an Estonian rock star (\\"the funniest part is he's a SUPER NERD\\"), raced motorcycles in Italy, took in the Muslim call to prayer from his Sarajevo hotel room, and formed opinions about the food and the women in Bosnia, in Romania, in Spain.      But as his first spring dawned in Switzerland, it must have felt cold, foreign, and expensive. Two days after his arrival in Switzerland, Snowden logged onto #arsificial, a channel on Ars Technica's public Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server. He'd been frequenting this space for a few months, chatting with whomever happened to be hanging out.      < TheTrueHOOHA> You guys can't say I look gay anymore. < User1> you look gay < TheTrueHOOHA> not anymore. I'm living in switzerland. i'm the straightest looking man inthe country < User2> rolpix < TheTrueHOOHA> as soon as my camera makes it here. :P < TheTrueHOOHA> you guys wouldn't believe how expensive shit is here, either < TheTrueHOOHA> you can't get tap water in restaraunts < User2> some examples, please < TheTrueHOOHA> they make you buy it in bottles < TheTrueHOOHA> glass bottles. 5 bucks a pop < User2> you buy the tap water? < TheTrueHOOHA> hamburgers are 15      The 15 hamburgers weren't even as good as McDonald's; they tasted \\"like greasy cardboard.\\" Everything was written in French and measured in meters (\\"God I hate metric,\\" wrote Snowden. \\"Why can't they use real numbers over here?\\"). The food packages had \\"kilojoules\\" listed on them. (\\"I'm not a battery!\\") Europeans couldn't even play movies right. (\\"They put an intermission in 300.\\")      Snowden logged on to the public IRC chat room with the same username he used across the Web: TheTrueHOOHA. The chat room was a place he would return to on dozens of occasions over his years in Switzerland, and his writings fill in details about the man who may go down as the most famous leaker in US history. Over the years that he hung out in #arsificial, Snowden went from being a fairly insulated American to being a man of the world. He would wax philosophical about money, politics, and in one notable exchange, about his uncompromising views about government leakers.      Four years later, Snowden took a job with a government contractor for the specific purpose of gathering secret information on domestic spying being done by the National Security Agency (NSA). In May, he hopped a plane to Hong Kong before the NSA knew where he was going. Once there, Snowden began a process of leaking top-secret documents to journalists. Snowden's first leak confirmed what activists had suspected but couldn't prove: there was a dragnet government surveillance program collecting information on every American's phone calls.      The chat logs are the most detailed view available into the formation of a man who has been hailed as a hero, and condemned as a traitor by leaders in his own country. In his public statements, Snowden is smooth and uncompromising, radiating intelligence. Snowden has insisted the focus remain on the leaked documents, not him. But he has also kept himself in the spotlight, speaking to three newspapers, doing live Q&As, and dribbling out more documents over time. Intentional or not, Snowden has maximized media attention. He is a Deep Throat for the social media age. Revealing American secrets is not enough; he has applied to be their chief interpreter as well.      An acerbic user, at home on #arsificial      IRC isn't Twitter. Much of the talk in chat channels isn't much more elevated than barroom banter, and Snowden's conversations as TheTrueHOOHA are no exception. But his personality and his beliefs do shine through. IRC chats can hold meaningful revelations about public figures, and Ars has used them as a reporting source before. Snowden was the kind of bar buddy willing to get into a political argument and never give up, even if he pissed off the whole room.      If IRC is a bar, then the #arsificial channel is the back room occupied by drinkers who feel the front is just too stuffy for them. Officially unofficial, #arsificial was created by users who chafed at the moderation in other Ars chatrooms. \\"This channel is unsupported and has no rules as such,\\" reads an automated message sent to users upon entry. Unlike on other Ars channels, for instance, chatter veering into racism or sexism wouldn't get a user silenced. \\"Under no circumstances should anyone complain to #mods about conduct in this channel,\\" read the entry message. \\"Anyone taking any complaint about #arsificial to #mods will receive a ban from #arsificial.\\"            It was an online destination Snowden would return to dozens of times over the next four years, often remaining quiet for hours on end before engaging in bursts of dialogue. The chat snippets show a strident personality, and at times, the inchoate ideology of a man who would ultimately take drastic measures to fight government secrecy. In #arsificial, Snowden was frequently someone ready to go to the mat for his beliefs—even when no one was on his side.      And he could be abrasive. Snowden didn't short stocks just to make money—he did it because it was the right thing to do. He saw himself as a paladin of the markets, bringing \\"liquidity\\" to all. As for those who didn't agree with him about the rightness of the gold standard or the need to eliminate Social Security, they weren't just mistaken—they were \\"retards.\\"      Four years ago, Snowden presented an image of always being sure of himself, sometimes to the point of seeming arrogant. He often thought he was the smartest guy in the room, and he let others know it.      The Ars IRC server doesn't log conversations, and there are no official transcripts of any discussions on that server. However, after learning that Snowden appeared to be an Ars user, we received chat logs from multiple longtime users who recalled IRC conversations with the user known as TheTrueHOOHA. That IRC user claimed he was the registered Ars user TheTrueHOOHA, who posted nearly 800 posts in Ars forums, including biographical information and photos that match Snowden.      Any handle can be adopted in IRC. However, such \\"identity theft,\\" while theoretically possible, is unheard of. These IRC remarks—like the Ars forum posts—correlate precisely to publicly known facts about Snowden's life.      Life in Switzerland      By April, a few months into his Swiss adventure, the chats show that Snowden was warming to the country. \\"Yeah… It's pretty cool so far,\\" he wrote. \\"The girls are gorgeous, too. Oh, and prostitution is legal.\\"      He detailed cultural observations about Switzerland, and his travels elsewhere, to anyone who happened to be in the chat room. \\"Jesus christ are the swiss rich,\\" he wrote. \\"The fucking mcdonald's workers make more than I do. They make like 50,000 franc a year.\\"      < TheTrueHOOHA> the roads are 35 inches wide < TheTrueHOOHA> with 9000 cars on them, two tram tracks, and a bus lane < TheTrueHOOHA> and a bike lane < TheTrueHOOHA> i imagine mirrors get clipped off all the time < TheTrueHOOHA> I'm afraid I'd bump into someone and have to pay for it. < User3> do they have a large immigrant population doing the lower-class work? < TheTrueHOOHA> Yeah.lots of unidentifiable southeast asian people and eastern europeans who don't speak french or english < TheTrueHOOHA> but don't get me wrong -- this place is amazing < TheTrueHOOHA> it's like living in a postcard < User4> TheTrueHOOHA: where are you? .ch? < TheTrueHOOHA> it's just nightmarishly expensive and horrifically classist < TheTrueHOOHA> Yeah. Geneva, Switzerland < User4> wicked! < TheTrueHOOHA> Yeah... it's pretty cool so far      It was cool, but Snowden was often critical of the Swiss. An average visitor to Switzerland talks about how great the chocolate is; Snowden saw a country of overpaid racists.      He admired those who managed to survive on the margins of society. In Switzerland, it was the hardscrabble intelligence of the Nigerian refugees that impressed him. \\"It's that whole necessity thing,\\" he asserted. \\"Motherfuckers have been there like eight months and speak all three languages. Not counting romansch, which doesn't count. Ever.\\"      And he kept coming back to #arsificial to share his adventures and observations.      < TheTrueHOOHA> everybody hates gypsies apparently < User5> what's there not to hate about gypsies < TheTrueHOOHA> poor gypsies < User6> Gypsies are the niggers of Europe. If not worse. < User6> I honestly don't have anything against them...

UPDATED:. 17:06 EST, 4 April 2013. Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed into law Thursday sweeping new restrictions on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who gunned down 20 child and six educators in the massacre. Alongside family members of some of the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Malloy signed the bill hours after the General Assembly approved the measure to give the state some of the toughest gun laws in the country. 'This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,' the governor said. 'We have come together in a way that few places in the nation have demonstrated the ability to do.' Scroll down for video. Taking action: Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy signed strict gun control measures into state law on Thursday while surrounded by the parents of victims from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Relatives: Nicole Hockley (right), the mother of slain Dylan Hockley, hugs State Senator Beth Bye as Neil Heslin (left), the father of victim Jesse Lewis, watches. Emotional: Mark Barden, the father of victim Daniel Barden, cries as he hugs Senator Richard Blumenthal following the signing of the law banning more than 100 weapons. Waiting for action: Relatives of two of the children who were killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting added to the poignancy of the signing of the gun control law on Thursday. In the hours after the shooting. December 14, as anxious family members gathered inside a firehouse and. waited for news, Malloy told them their loved ones were not coming home. He said later that he didn't think it was right for the families to. wait for the victims to be formally identified. Now, Connecticut joins states. including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts in having. the country's strongest gun control laws, said Brian Malte, director of. mobilization for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in. Washington. 'This would put Connecticut right at the top or near the top of the states with the strongest gun laws,' Malte said. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. Some parts of the bill. would take effect immediately after Malloy's signature, including. background checks for all firearms sales. Support: Now Connecticut is one of the states with the most strict gun control laws in the country. Advocate: Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy has been held up as a leader on the issue of gun control. Heartfelt: Malloy was the one to inform the waiting parents on December 14th that their children had been killed. Following a total of more than 13. hours of respectful and at times somber debate, the House of. Representatives and the Senate voted in favor of the 139-page bill. crafted by leaders from both major parties in the Democratic-controlled. General Assembly. Both were bipartisan votes. 'I pray today's bill — the most. far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country — will prevent other. families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 Sandy Hook. families have felt,' said House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz. 'Don't tread on me': Gun control opponents. outside the statehouse in Hartford, Connecticut, as lawmakers debated. the new laws passed last night which ban more than 100 guns and. large-capacity ammo magazines. Gun control advocates: Lauren Garrett, a supporter of gun regulation and her son Robert display a sign that reads 'Ban AR-15's' inside the statehouse in Hartford yesterday. Colorado and New York also passed new. gun control requirements in the wake of the Newtown shooting, in which a. 20-year-old gunman used a military-style semi-automatic rifle. Compared with Connecticut's. legislation, which, for example, bans the sale or purchase of ammunition. magazines holding more than 10 rounds, New York restricted magazines to. seven bullets and gave owners of higher-capacity magazines a year to. sell them elsewhere. Colorado banned ammunition magazines that hold more. than 15 rounds. President Barack Obama has urged lawmakers at the national level to take similar action. Connecticut House majority leader Joe. Aresimowicz said of last night's decision: 'I pray today's bill - the. most far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country - will prevent. other families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26. Sandy Hook families have felt.' Some of the measures take effect. right away, including an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban,. background checks for all firearms sales and a ban on the sale or. purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Defining issue: President Barack Obama speaks about gun control at the Denver Police Academy in Colorado yesterday. He is pushing for new nationwide gun controls but faces opposition from powerful groups. The massacre reignited a national. debate on gun control, and President Obama has made gun safety one of. the defining issues of his second term, which started a month after the. shooting. His proposed gun control measures. have largely stalled in Congress, however, and Obama has planned a trip. to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in. Washington. Legislative leaders, aware of the attention on them, struck a rare bipartisan agreement they want to serve as a national model. Long debate: Rob Kane, a Republican senator serving towns in western Connecticut, left, questions Senate President Donald Williams, D-Brooklyn, during a discussion of a gun bill on the Senate floor last night. Tense: Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, left, and Senator Carlo Leone, D-Stamford and Darien, watch a vote for an amendment of the gun-control bill at the Capitol in Hartford. President Barack Obama has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term, which began just a month after the bloody Sandy Hook massacre. Connecticut is the latest state to introduce stricter gun controls in response to the 26 killings on December 14, joining New York, Massachusetts, California and Colorado. But Obama's proposed national gun control measures have largely stalled in Congress, however, and the president has planned a trip to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in Washington. He visited Colorado yesterday and repeated his call for universal background checks for gun buyers - a measure that has better chances of winning enough support in Congress than an assault weapons ban or limits on large-capacity ammunition magazines. Obama's visit was heavy with political symbolism because Colorado recently expanded gun control laws despite being a western, largely rural state where gun ownership is a cherished right. Colorado suffered two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history - at Columbine school in 1999 and at a movie theater last year. It has expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines. Obama said Colorado's action shows 'there doesn't have to be a conflict' between keeping citizens safe and protecting the right to bear firearms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby claims more guns keep people safer and have blocked many efforts towards stricter gun controls. Several county sheriffs in Colorado have also vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions. Senate. President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat, said: 'The tragedy in. Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends. politics. 'It is the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the country.' The. bill passed 26-10 in the Senate and 105-44 in the House of. Representatives. Both were bipartisan votes. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. But some lawmakers said they felt the legislation did not do enough to address mental health issues. Representative Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican lawmaker from Newtown, acknowledged the legislation 'is not perfect' and he hoped would be 'a beginning in addressing critical mental health needs.' Representative Douglas McCrory, D-Hartford, said he felt the bill 'doesn't speak to the issue of gun violence that has permeated our cities.' He said families in his district who've lost children to gun violence have not received the same level of attention from state politicians as the Newtown families. But Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, whose district includes Newtown, said he felt he was representing the interests of the Sandy Hook victims as he cast his vote. 'I stand here as their voice, as their elected representative,' he said, reciting the names of the 26 victims at the school. Lawmakers appeared to still be stunned by the enormity of the massacre. 'When. a child is sent to school, their parents expect them to be safe. The. Sandy Hook shooting rampage was a parent's, a school system's, a. community's and the nation's worst nightmare,' said Republican state. Sen. Toni Boucher of Wilton. Horror: Connecticut State Police lead a line of. children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. on Friday, December 14, 2012 after the massacre at the school which. claimed 26 lives. Grief: Young children wait outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shootings. Tears: A woman waits to hear about her sister, a teacher, following a shooting at the Sandy Hook. Gun rights advocates, who greatly. outnumbered gun control supporters in demonstrations held earlier in the. day at the Capitol, railed against the proposals as misguided and. unconstitutional. Newtown school gunman Adam Lanza: He slaughtered. 20 first-grade pupils and six teachers with shots from a legally bought high-powered rifle. 'No! No! No!' and 'Read the bill!' they chanted. 'We want them to write laws that are sensible,' said Ron Pariseau, of Pomfret, who was angry he'll be made a felon if he doesn't register his weapons that will no longer be sold in Connecticut. 'What they're proposing will not stop anything.' By the time the Senate voted around 6.30pm, many of the gun rights advocates had gone home, leaving behind proponents of the bill who applauded when the tally in the Senate was read. The halls were mostly empty by the time the House voted at 2.26am this morning. Among the gun control advocates were Dan and Lauren Garrett, of Hamden, wearing green shirts in honor of the Sandy Hook victims. The Garretts traveled to Hartford with their 10-month-old son, Robert, to watch the bill's passage. They said they hope lawmakers will build on the proposal. 'It's just the beginning of this bill. In six months from now, it's going to get stronger and stronger,' Dan Garrett said. 'I think they're watching us all over the country.' Highlights:","output":"1. Connecticut Governor Dannel P.

Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in hunting. One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha, which translates as \\"the deer hunter\\" (mriga means deer; vyadha means hunter). The word Mriga, in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings. In the epic Ramayana, Dasharatha, the father of Rama, is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed Shravana, mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, Ravana kidnapped his wife, Sita, from their hut, while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother Lakshman went after him.

Josh A:","output":"Step 1: Determine a setting and time period for our movie plot. To create a relatable and engaging story, let's choose a modern, urban setting in the United States. Our protagonist, Josh, will be in his mid-20s, struggling with the loss of his parents and dealing with the pain that comes with it. The time period of the story will be during the present day. Step 2: Flesh out our main character, Josh. Josh is a young man who recently lost his parents in a tragic accident, leaving him overwhelmed with grief and pain. He's been trying to take care of himself and his younger sister, Lily, who is still in high school. Josh works long hours at a local restaurant, barely making ends meet, while also taking care of his sister. Step 3: Introduce a supernatural element or external conflict to drive the story forward. While walking home late one night, Josh stumbles upon an old, mysterious woman who seems to have a deep understanding of his pain. She offers him the chance to wish for relief from his suffering. Josh, desperate to find some solace, accepts her offer, not knowing what consequences his wish might bring. Step 4: Develop the consequences of the wish and how Josh's life changes. After making the wish, Josh finds that his emotional pain has been transferred to his sister, Lily. She now bears all of the grief and sorrow that Josh once carried, and Josh must come to terms with the consequences of his wish. Step 5: Create a conflict resolution or a path of redemption for Josh. Realizing the terrible mistake he's made, Josh becomes determined to find a way to take back his pain and help his sister. Through a series of trials, he learns the importance of facing his grief head-on and learning to cope with it, rather than wishing it away. The old mysterious woman reappears and sees the transformation of Josh's character. She agrees to undo the wish, allowing Josh to take his pain back from Lily. Step 6: Concludes the story with an emotional realization and conclusion. Josh and Lily's journey leads them to understand the importance of facing life's challenges together and supporting one another through their pain. The siblings grow closer, and their bond becomes stronger. The movie ends with Josh and Lily finding the strength to move forward, using their shared experiences to build a brighter future. So, to summarize, the movie plot revolves around Josh, a young man struggling with his parent's sudden death and the pain it caused. Desperate for relief, he accepts an offer from a mysterious old woman to transfer his pain, only to find that his sister takes on this burden. Racked with guilt, Josh undertakes a series of trials to undo his wish and learns to face his grief, eventually strengthening his bond with his sister and moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I bought the car about seven months ago, and have had no problems.  I think the price was a little high, but that's because I am a terrible negotiator - and since I expected to take it to Tim whenever I had problems, I didn't want to make a stink by being a fussy purchaser.

His small, cozy home reflects his love for vintage and eccentric furniture. He's constantly on the lookout for new additions but barely keeps up with the expenses of his ever-growing collection.

Unaware of how quickly the expenses will accumulate, he gets in over his head as he tries to impress Madison with his ever-changing furniture collection. Archie's life spirals out of control when he becomes obsessed with acquiring rare and expensive pieces, desperately trying to maintain the façade of a successful collector. Act 3: One day, Archie returns home only to find his beloved furniture repossessed due to his failure to make payments. Devastated and embarrassed, Archie locks himself in his now empty house. Madison, worried for her friend, pays him a visit. She walks into the empty house and helps him confront the reality of his situation. Act 4: With Madison's help, Archie realizes the importance of living within his means and valuing the sentimental meaning behind his collection, rather than trying to impress others. Determined to make amends, Archie finds various odd jobs around the town to repay his debt.

Madison introduces him to small antique shops, flea markets, and auctions where they find unique pieces together.

Emotional distress encompasses a wide range of feelings, including sadness, fear, anger, and confusion, which children may experience when their parents separate. The other options do not seem to accurately reflect the primary concern of most parents during a divorce: - Bad feelings: Although this may also be a consequence of divorce, it is too vague and does not capture the full range of emotions children may experience. - Richer: While financial concerns may arise during a divorce, the couple's primary concern is likely the emotional well-being of their children, rather than making them richer. - Freedom: While divorce may lead to a sense of freedom for the parents, it is unlikely this would be their main concern regarding its impact on their children. - Two Christmases: This option highlights a possible positive aspect for the children; however, it is not the primary concern for parents during a divorce.

Oh, boy, God bless the 1970's, we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade: The Exorcist, Jaws, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and now, Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, I mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me. My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money. What the heck? It's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of Toy Story, pretty much down to a key, only this was a thousand times scarier, Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children. Whenever Marcella leaves the room, Raggedy Ann, along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life. On Marcella's birthday, a new doll, Babette, arrives from Paris, France to the United States of America. Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll, but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home. However, the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. Out in the world outside the nursery, the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees, a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel, he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking, runs over the edge of a cliff, into a deep pit. In this pit they encounter the Greedy, who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette and believe me, it just gets weirder from this point on. While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie, this was actually pretty creative. Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it, you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, I just don't know who to recommend it too. As scared as I was, I have to admit I'm glad I watched it, sometimes you need a \\"WTF?!\\" movie to spice up your selection, believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me. It's official, that doll is just plain creepy, let's just put it this way, there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything, a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs, a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother, a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs. Yikes. 7/10 Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"The review is mixed with both positive and negative aspects.

Write a title for this article: In only a few days, South Korea's biggest scandal in years has done what six decades of diplomacy and bloodshed couldn't. It has united the rival Koreas, at least in one area: indignation against South Korea's leader. North Korea's propaganda mavens have never been shy in calling South Korean President Park Geun-hye an incompetent, power-hungry clone of her late dictator father, Park Chung-hee — and that's when they're pulling their punches. Inconceivable a week ago, many South Koreans now seem to be reaching Pyongyang levels of fury over an investigation into whether Park allowed a longtime confidante with no official government role to manipulate her administration from the shadows. The North's fondness for vicious threats is generally missing in the South, but the anger over the scandal — sometimes partisan, mostly spontaneous on the part of many South Koreans, but more violent and somewhat canned in the North, where carefully cultivated outrage is a state commodity — often seems to be in lockstep. For instance, in wording that North Korea would be right at home with, Ahn Cheol-soo, a lawmaker from a small South Korean opposition party and a potential presidential candidate, recently said of Park: \\"You no longer have the authority to destroy the constitution. You no longer have the authority to stomp on the pride of our people.\\" Here's how a similar sentiment looked when North Korea's main newspaper recently attacked Park: \\"It's deplorable that the South's politics have become the joke of the world and its economy and people's livelihoods are left in shreds.\\" To be clear, the expressions in South Korea, even at their sharpest, are still a long way from the odious linguistic swamp of violence and sexism that characterizes much of North Korea's propaganda. The North, for instance, has called Park a \\"dirty prostitute who licks her master's groin,\\" an \\"aging witch,\\" a \\"female dog\\" and an \\"American parrot.\\" Pyongyang has also repeatedly called for her death. But there has been an uptick in both rage and sexism in the South, especially online, where Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, have been called \\"crazy bitch,\\" ''chicken head,\\" a slur meant to attack their intelligence, and \\"stupid Gangnam ajumma,\\" a term often used to insult middle-aged women living in affluent southern Seoul. People have also declared that South Korea will never again vote for a female president or trust a woman's leadership. It is not just happening in obscure corners of South Korea's social media or the web, never the cream of public discourse. \\"Park Geun-hye threw away her authority as (the person) ultimately responsible (for governing the state) to a common street woman of unknown roots,\\" Jae-myung Lee, the opposition mayor of Seongnam, told more than 10,000 people taking part in a recent anti-Park rally, referring to Choi. \\"Park has lost her authority as president and has shown that she doesn't have the basic qualities to govern a country.\\" That Park, who has 15 months to go in her single five-year term, should go has long been a mainstay of North Korean rhetoric. But similar sentiments are also emerging in South Korean media. \\"If we had to pick one person who made the country into the shattered mess that it is now, it's none other than President Park,\\" the South's Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday, calling for Park's resignation. \\"The citizens no longer want Park to govern state affairs ... She lost the political leadership to persuade and guide the ruling and opposition parties, the parliament and the people. Her moral authority as the head of state has fallen to the ground ... Continuing this state for another year and three months will make everyone miserable.\\" North Korea's state media have at times seemed overwhelmed with the amount of negative stories, both international and South Korean, about Park, and have often just rounded up the coverage, with some insulting comment added. Six days after Park first acknowledged that she had sent Choi, the daughter of a shadowy religious figure who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, drafts of her speeches for editing, North Korea's main newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, released a lengthy, painstaking summary of the saga, replete with sexist, violent insults. The newspaper described Park and Choi as \\"two women who have lost their minds.\\" It also broke down reports that Choi influenced important government decisions, including Park's move to shut down the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, a jointly run factory park in the North Korean city of Kaesong. \\"This shows to the world that Park Geun-hye is not merely a first-class dog controlled by a large monster that is the United States, but also doubly and triply a puppet manipulated by strings pulled by one 'Gangnam' woman,\\" the North Korean newspaper said, referring to the Seoul neighborhood where Choi reportedly built a fortune on real estate investments. Observers of North Korean propaganda have wondered about the length of time it took the newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party, to weigh in on the scandal — nearly a week. It's almost as if the paper's propaganda experts, after firing at much smaller targets for so long, couldn't quite believe the huge gift they'd been given. Pyongyang has more recently stepped things up. For instance, the North's official Korean Central News Agency published a statement by a Foreign Ministry unit said that Park's actions had caused a \\"hideous power-backed scandal unprecedented in history.\\" It predicted that a \\"mass struggle\\" of enraged South Koreans will leave Park at a crossroads where she is forced to choose between quitting her presidency on her own or facing impeachment. With tens of thousands of South Korean protesters calling for Park's ouster over the weekend and bigger crowds expected in coming days, Pyongyang's breathless, over-the-top propaganda might not be so far off the mark. Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.","output":"Title: \\"Unprecedented Scandal Unites North and South Korea in Outrage: The Shadows Manipulating South Korea's Leader\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: He wondered if this recommendation was the appropriate place. This sentence implies that a character is questioning the suitability of a recommendation and whether it is the correct location or option for a specific purpose. There is some uncertainty involved, with the character expressing doubt or seeking confirmation.  Sentence 2: He inquired if the recommendation was appropriate  Similar to the first sentence, this statement also suggests that the character is voicing a concern about the recommendation. The difference lies in the choice of words – \\"inquired\\" and \\"appropriate.\\" The verb \\"inquired\\" implies that the character is actively seeking information, while \\"appropriate\\" signifies the question is about the overall suitability rather than being about the location or option specifically. Now, let's examine the three options presented: 1. Yes: This option would suggest that the situation or information expressed in Sentence 2 can be directly derived from Sentence 1. While both sentences are related and involve a character asking about the recommendation, they are not exactly the same, as the focus of the inquiry is slightly different. 2. It is not possible to tell: Given that both sentences revolve around the character questioning the recommendation and its suitability, it could be argued that there is some level of entailment between them. However, the differences in the wording and focus of the inquiry make it unclear if the second sentence is wholly entailed by the first one. 3. No: This option implies that there is no relationship between the two sentences and that the situation or information in Sentence 2 cannot be inferred from Sentence 1. While there are differences between the two, they are structurally related and represent a character questioning a recommendation. Considering this analysis, the most accurate answer is (2). It is not possible to tell if the second sentence is entirely entailed by the first sentence. Although there are connections between the two, especially the aspect of inquiry regarding a recommendation and its appropriateness, the focus of the inquiry is subtly different in each sentence.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"The suggested answer does not provide an accurate response to the question regarding who contacted Muhammad. To help you decide, here's a more comprehensive answer that addresses the question: The main figure who contacted Prophet Muhammad was the Angel Gabriel (also known as Jibril in Arabic), who is considered one of the most prominent angels in Islam and other Abrahamic religions. The first revelation to Muhammad occurred in 610 AD, when he was meditating in the Cave of Hira, near Mecca. It was at this time that Angel Gabriel appeared to him and conveyed the first words of God (Allah) to Muhammad, beginning the period of his prophethood. These revelations from Allah through Angel Gabriel continued intermittently over a period of 23 years, and the messages were later compiled into the Islamic holy book, the Quran. As the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad was responsible for relaying these revelations to the people as guidance and instruction. The suggested answer provides some background information on Muhammad's life prior to his prophetic experience, such as his work as a merchant and shepherd and his marriage at the age of 25. However, it does not address the specific question of who contacted him.

Grant for The New York Times Landon Garrett, 7, left, and Collin Troll, 6, at Montauk Marine Basinâs shark-hunting contest last month. This weekend the marine basin will host a different kind of tournament, in which not a single shark will be killed. More Photos » MONTAUK, N.Y. â This seaside community is increasingly getting attention as a trendy summer playground for the wealthy, but for decades it has been known for something else entirely: killing sharks. The shark-fishing craze started here in the 1970s with a colorful push from a local angler, Frank Mundus, who popularized what he called âMonster Fishingâ and who was a model for the grizzled shark hunter, Quint, in âJaws.â Today the piers are decorated with tails and dorsal fins of the sharks that swim these parts: threshers, makos, blues and the occasional great whites. The collection is replenished by the annual tournaments that offer pots of hundreds of thousands of dollars for the biggest sharks. The winning beast is hung by its tail, like a toothy testimony to manâs fear conquered. Every now and then environmentalists would show up, carrying signs warning about the global decline of shark populations from overfishing and calling for an end to the slaughter. They were mostly ignored in a place where bumper stickers declare that the National Marine Fisheries Service, which regulates fishing hauls, has been âDestroying Fishermen and Their Communities Since 1976.â But times change. And this summer, an artist, April Gornik, and an environmental group, Concerned Citizens of Montauk, led a successful effort to persuade some of the most prominent shark fishermen to try something new, and they hope, lasting: a contest where not a single shark is killed. Instead, all of the sharks caught in the contest, being held this weekend, will be photographed and released where they are caught. Fishermen will be asked to use circle hooks, believed to inflict less damage on the fish. And they will be asked to help scientific study by attaching tracking tags to select sharks before they are let go. The winner, determined based on a point system, will receive a painting by Ms. Gornik and 6,000. It is enough to make some of the old fishermen here wonder what is happening to the world. They lament that their friends are letting the environmentalists get to them, and predict that a shark contest without a winning carcass on the dock will not be viewed as a shark contest at all by the hundreds who still come for them. âPeople want to see sharks,â Jack Passie, the captain of the charter boat Windy, which ties off at the Star Island Yacht Club, declared emphatically. But for those who agree to participate â among them the musician Jimmy Buffett, organizers say â it is a chance for Montauk to lead the way once again, this time to help preserve the shark population. âFishermen of Montauk are aware of one thing: The shark fishery is probably going to come to an end down the road,â said Carl Darenberg, the owner of the Montauk Marine Basin, which held one of the first shark-hunting contests in the country 43 years ago and will host the catch-and-release contest. âIf you want to have fish around to catch in the future, you have to make adjustments.â As a fourth-generation Montauk fisherman, Mr. Darenberg, 63, has extra credibility. His great-grandmother came here soon after emigrating from Sweden, having married the local lighthouse keeper. He has been around long enough to remember Mr. Mundus before he was legend. âHe wanted to learn more about how sharks tick,â Mr. Darenberg said one recent afternoon at his bait shop. âAnd he sat there and caught them and caught them and caught them when everybody else was out catching swordfish and marlin.â The technique was simple enough: dump containers of chum into the water and wait for the sharks to be drawn by the wafting odor of blood. Mr. Mundus made a great show of it all the same, playing off the persistent shark phobia. Charging up to 1,800 a day, he would take his passengers â among them the âJawsâ author Peter Benchley â on his âMonster Fishingâ expeditions. His weapon of choice was not a rod and reel but a harpoon attached to a series of floating barrels to wear the fish down. Some saw his techniques as silly, but the results were as plain as the 4,500-pound great white he brought to the piers in the summer of â64. This niche pursuit took off in the 1970s because of two unrelated developments. The swordfish, marlin and tuna pursued by most sport fishermen became increasingly scarce, and the director Steven Spielberg turned Mr. Benchleyâs book into a hit movie. âÂ âJawsâ changed the world,â said Michael Potts, a second-generation Montauk fisherman and the captain of the Blue Fin IV. The town was besieged with aspiring shark hunters, and their appetite was equal to that of their prey. The carcasses piled up. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article and a picture caption misstated part of the name of the marina where a catch-and-release contest will be held this weekend. It is the Montauk Marine Basin, not the Montauk Boat Basin. Summary:","output":"In Montauk, a seaside community in New York, there has been a long history of shark fishing. People would catch sharks and win prizes for catching the biggest ones. But now there is a new kind of contest where no sharks have to be killed. Instead, people will take pictures of the sharks they catch and let them go free. This helps to protect sharks, many of which are in danger because too many are being caught. Some people are not happy with the change, but others think it is a good way to help keep sharks around for the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors  kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official  sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules. Today all soccer teams play by them. Soccer is called \\"football\\" everywhere but in the United States. The game is played mostly with feet. No players except the goalie ( ) may touch the ball with their hands. They may control the ball with any part of the body except their hands. Soccer is by far the world's most popular sport.

At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Where will Trump meet with Kim Jung Un? Options:  A. not enough information  B. North Korea  C. South Korea  D. Singapore A:","output":"D. Singapore"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: An occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people's buttons., the 4th Man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct. The story's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously twisted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers up Gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man. He's shiftless, delusional, unable to control his urges, afraid to commit to meaningful relationships, and utterly apathetic about life in general. As the character himself states at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth. The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of spiders consuming Christ, and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction. He chases off one man (a boyfriend presumably), then chases another at a train station. Later, at a lecture, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, or perhaps she has more nefarious plans.. She quickly captures Gerard in her web, enticing him with sex and money, having plenty of both. She's also got secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she lonely, and genuinely looking for someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow, luring Gerard to his death? Will Garard be the 4th man she kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to. This is an interesting movie, with a lot of sex and intrigue. It's similar to Verhoeven's<em>Basic instinct</em>, but has a lot more depth, and is certainly more shocking. There's a lot of very strong gay content, which may make some viewers squirm. Highly recommended for fans of intelligent psychological thrillers, or anyone looking for something entirely new.","output":"This review talks about a movie called \\"The 4th Man.\\" The person who wrote the review thinks the movie is interesting and has a lot of surprises.

Title: Tron: Legacy Movie plot: 1989: Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), now CEO of ENCOM, tells his seven year-old son, Sam (Owen Best), about his adventures in the Grid, a completely digital world within the Tron computer system that Flynn created. Flynn explains to Sam that, with his counterpart Clu (Jeff Bridges, body performance; John Reardon) - the second of a Codified Likeness Utility modeled after Flynn - and the security program Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), he discovered something amazing within the Grid; a miracle. Sam asks what it is but Flynn holds the story for next time before putting Sam to bed and going to work. A series of newspaper articles and television reports follow announcing the mysterious disappearance of Kevin Flynn after that night. Since the passing of Sam's mother (Amy Esterle) several years prior, Flynn's absence leaves him effectively orphaned and puts ENCOM's future in a state of jeopardy. Sam is left to stay with his paternal grandparents (Donnelly Rhodes and Belinda Montgomery), questioning the nature of his father's disappearance.20 years later, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) rides his motorcycle through the night streets towards ENCOM tower. He hacks into the building and evades security cameras as he makes his way upstairs. Meanwhile, a board meeting is being held where Richard Mackey (Jeffrey Nordling) presents the new OS-12, a secure operating system. When Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) inquires about improvements to the system, given the high prices already charged, young Edward Dillinger II (Cillian Murphy: uncredited) says that the idea of sharing software for free disappeared with Kevin Flynn. Sam breaks into the control room and swaps out the OS-12 master file so that when Mackey attempts to run it, all he sees is a repetitive video of Sam's dog Marv (a Boston terrier). Sam smirks as he passes the boardroom, followed closely by a security guard (Dan Joffre).

Definition: Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. Input:   AITA First off obligatory, I'm a lurker on Reddit, not really a poster so I hope I'm following all the rules. Second, I got the nerve to write this after seeing all the posts lamenting posts seeking validation on here. This story likely has two assholes me (27), him (29) but maybe it's just me, where I'm mostly concerned and wondering if I am, in fact, the asshole is with the very last step: Where I cut my friend off and stopped trying. I'll tell it as simply as I can. This summer I fell into a very deep depression after a bad breakup, which led to a quickly deteriorating relationship with my parents (they liked her more than me and me more when I was with her), and this put a huge strain on me and my job suffered. I hadn't had a roommate in the better part of a decade but I was doing so poorly on my own that I knew I was only looking for one more excuse to commit suicide. Depression has been a part of my life since I was 12 but I'd always been able to cope, up until this summer. I was high most days/nights and developed an issue with painkillers and alcohol. My friend of about 6 months had quickly become one of my best friends and always found an excuse to ask me to move in with him long before all this went down - his motivation was self-admitted as saving on rent money and the fact that this was his first time living alone and didn't like it, also friendship. Me (introvert), him (extrovert). I took him up on the offer one day, explained to him my reason why was that I was afraid to be alone and my lease was up in 3 months anyway. His landlord didn't give a rip about leases and signing papers (another conversation for another day) and that meant everyone was fine with me living there for as long as I needed/wanted. Where things get complicated is with my buddies arrangement he said clearly I would owe no rent on the months I was still paying my old rent. I'd cover all the utilities for those months and generally, he'd just be a good dude. For my old apartment, I was still on the hook for 3 months rent, unless someone started a new lease with them. It would be a per diem kind of thing...1,000/m is 33/day so if someone took over on the 15th of the last month, that would be 500 back to me. Someone did take over on the 23rd of the second month (231 back to me). I paid rent full rent to my friend on the 3rd month. I did not give him the 231 as I probably should have, reason being was my suffering career which was 100% commission (tag [r/choosingbeggers](https://www.reddit.com/r/choosingbeggers)) and I did cover all the utilities for the first two months, we went 50/50 on everything after that. Two months go by. I'm stoned and drunk most nights, I'm making just enough money to pay my bills, eat ramen, and go to therapy for the first time. Never been this kind of broke. I'm not at all better and wouldn't be for several months. My priest, friend, and trusty counsel-giver suggests education and seminary. Says he doesn't care if I become a religious or not and suggests I use this as a way to get a free education, find a new lease on life, and pursue a living that actually means something to me. After a month of deliberation, I took him up on it. I actually get excited again, like really excited, like watched a sunrise and smiled while sipping coffee kind of excited. I tell my roommate, and first words out of his mouth is \\"moocher\\" he immediately says I won't make it and shouldn't do it. I was shocked. I explained that I was open to the religious life but also not expecting it and the diocese knew that, they were just willing to take a chance on me and so I would take a chance on them. I explained that if this didn't work out, the education would still afford me a better, more fulfilling life than I had been living before and I saw this as a way out of my depression and into better living. At this point, he demanded the full second month's rent, which I did not pay and was already 2 months ago, and began wanting rent on a weekly basis. I did pay the rent weekly but told him no on the second months rent as that was already long since spent and couldn't do back payments like that. Every single day he tells me I won't make it in school. Every day I tell him I don't care, I'm trying. I begin to cut him out as just one more negative voice in my head. Some time goes by, he wants all new tires for his truck. He was going to trade labor to the guy for about a quarter of the cost. Me, being the genius that I am just got a new credit card with an introductory 150 bonus if I spent 500 or more in three months, my 400 IQ continues to kick in and I tell him to put it on my card and I'll give him 50 of it. 840 goes onto the credit card. He pays back 400. I go to school. He gives me two post-dated checks for the remaining 480 spread out over one month. I had no problem with this. He cancels both checks a week after I leave and says he'll Venmo me the money when he's ready. I text him once a week for two months, he always says he'll send it next week or next pay period. After 8 weeks of this I give up. This whole time he's been making about 3X as much as me with similar bills. I apply the 150 to the bill and donate plasma to pay off the rest. 18 credits and 15hrs/week of service work, an actual job wasn't practical, wise, or actually allowed. He continues to text me periodically, condescending remarks like \\"making lots of friends?\\" \\"Did you remember your lunch?\\". If this doesn't sound condescending, just trust that I know his humor. Even when the texts got nicer, I stopped responding and the friendship is over with me feeling like he stuck me with a credit card debt I had no good way of repaying and a whole lot of negative feedback from a friend who was supposed to have my back. TL;DR: Friend helped me out with a place to stay as I recovered from depression. Education was offered to me as a means to a new lease on life and I accepted the offer. The friend gave me daily negative feedback on my decision to the point that I had already begun to shut him out before leaving. He left me with credit card debt and negativity and so I cut him out.

Context_4 : Tobacco Road is an historic tobacco-producing area of central North Carolina and is often used when referring to sports (particularly basketball) played among rival Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) universities which are located close to each other in North Carolina. The phrase originated as the title of a novel set in Georgia, but it migrated to North Carolina because of the state's primacy in tobacco production. Three of the schools (Duke, UNC, and North Carolina State) are part of Research Triangle and are separated by no more than 25 mi , and Wake Forest lies about 100 mi west of the other three. It was formerly much closer to the other three, having originally been located in the town of Wake Forest, North Carolina, until 1956. All four are no more than 6 mi from Interstate 40; the road has been called \\"Tobacco Road\\" in national sports media. (However, until the late 1980s—after tobacco had started to decline in North Carolina due to US federal anti-tobacco actions—I-40 did not reach Durham, Chapel Hill, or Raleigh. Rather, \\"Tobacco Road\\" would have been US Highway 70.) The proximity of these schools to one another and the membership of each school in the Atlantic Coast Conference have created a natural rivalry among students, fans, and alumni. North Carolina State University's \\"Red and White Song\\" mentions each of the four universities in its lyrics. Context_5 : The University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame ) is a Catholic research university located adjacent to South Bend, Indiana, in the United States.

The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president. Context_6 : James W. Silver (June 28, 1907 – July 25, 1988) was a historian, author of \\"Mississippi: The Closed Society\\", and professor at the University of Mississippi and later at the University of Notre Dame and the University of South Florida. When rioting erupted on the Ole Miss campus after James Meredith became the University of Mississippi's first African-American student and federal troops moved in to keep order, Silver befriended Meredith. In a speech to the Southern Historical Association in the Fall of 1963, he analyzed the violence with which Mississippi was resisting desegregation. Mississippi was, he said, \\"a closed society\\" -- \\"totalitarian,\\" \\"monolithic,\\" \\"corrupt.\\" The speech received widespread media coverage, and he expanded his analysis in a book, \\"Mississippi: The Closed Society\\" (1964). His advocacy of racial change had subjected him to hostility in Mississippi and even an attempt by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission to have him fired. That effort failed, but Silver took a job teaching at Notre Dame University in Indiana. He taught at Notre Dame from 1965 until 1969. He left Notre Dame to teach history at the University of South Florida until he retired in 1982.

Boyz II Men is an American R&B vocal group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies. They are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet including bass Michael McCary, who left the group in 2003 due to health issues. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international success. Motown issued The Remix Collection, a compilation of remixes of various Boyz II Men songs from Cooleyhighharmony and II. The group itself had opposed the release of the collection, because they felt the compilation did not represent Boyz II Men's best work. After the label released the album without their permission, there was a dispute between the company and the group. Boyz II Men initiated their own recording company Stonecreek (which released material by artists such as Uncle Sam), and they arranged for Stonecreek's distribution by Epic Records, not Motown.  Boyz II Men's third studio album, Evolution, was released during 1997 to mixed reviews and sold three million copies, far below the stratospheric success of II's (12 million copies) and Cooleyhighharmony (9 million). Only one of Evolution's singles, the Jam/Lewis-penned \\"Four Seasons of Loneliness\\", reached number 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The second single, the Babyface-helmed \\"A Song for Mama\\" (the theme song to the Babyface-produced film Soul Food) was a Top 10 success, but the follow-up \\"Can't Let Her Go\\" underperformed.  The global tour began in 1997 to promote Evolution was very successful in terms of ticket sales, but behind the scenes, Boyz II Men was wracked by conflicts with their record label and internal conflicts among the members of the group. Making matters worse, health problems began to take their toll on the group as well. While on tour to support the Evolution album, Wanya Morris developed a polyp on his vocal cords, and the group was forced to postpone part of the tour until he recovered. McCary's scoliosis meant that he was unable to participate in most of the group's dance routines.  Boyz II Men were nominated for 2 Grammys in 1998: Best R&B Album for Evolution and Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for \\"A Song for Mama\\".

Question: Abner Spudder is killed while trying to put on what? Movie title: Battleground Movie plot: In mid-December 1944 Pvt. Jim Layton (Marshall Thompson) and his buddy Pvt. William J. Hooper (Scotty Beckett) are fresh replacements assigned to separate companies in the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. As a newcomer Layton receives a chilly welcome from his squad. PFC Holley (Van Johnson) returns to the company after recuperating from a wound sustained from fighting in the Netherlands. Instead of going on leave in Paris, the squad is trucked back to the front to help stop a surprise German breakthrough in the Ardennes. They stop that night in the town of Bastogne. The platoon is put up for the night in the apartment of a local young woman, Denise (Denise Darcel), with whom Holley hopes to fraternize. Jarvess (John Hodiak) is informed by Denise that she is taking care of two orphaned French girls. Jarvess later goes on guard in the village, where he runs into a group of battle weary soldiers. The soldiers inform Jarvess that they are making a \\"strategic withdrawal\\". The next morning, led by Platoon Sgt. Kinnie (James Whitmore), the men are ordered to dig in on the outskirts of town. Just as they are nearly done, they are ordered to a new location and have to dig in again. Holley, Layton and Kippton (Douglas Fowley) stand guard that night at a roadblock. A patrol of German soldiers, disguised as American soldiers, infiltrates their position and later blows up a nearby bridge. In the morning the squad awakes to a heavy winter storm. Roderigues (Ricardo MontalbÃ¡n), a Latino from Los Angeles, is delighted by the novelty of snow, but his foxhole mate Pop Stazak (George Murphy), awaiting a \\"dependency discharge\\" that will send him home, is unimpressed. Layton goes over to see his friend Hooper, only to find that he had been killed hours before, and that no one in his company knew his name. Kinnie informs the squad about the infiltration and sends out a patrolâHolley, Roderigues and Jarvess to move through the woods. Just before they start out, the platoon is shelled by German artillery,...

Does it follow that \\"Albert smiled.\\"? Choose your answer from: [-] yes; [-] it is not possible to tell; [-] no;","output":"Yes, it follows that \\"Albert smiled.\\" A detailed and long answer explaining this would consider the quotation's context and how it describes Albert's reaction. The statement \\"A delighted grin spread slowly over Albert's countenance\\" points towards Albert's emotional response or satisfaction to whatever has been said to him.  In this context, \\"countenance\\" refers to a person's facial expression, which plays a significant role in conveying their emotional state. The use of the word \\"delighted\\" gives a strong hint that Albert's reaction is a positive one—he is pleased with the statement or question directed at him. Additionally, the phrase \\"grin spread slowly\\" indicates a gradual, increasing expression of contentment or happiness, leading to a smile. Thus, we can associate the detailed description of Albert's reaction, where it's mentioned that the \\"delighted grin spread slowly over Albert's countenance,\\" with Albert smiling. His facial expression clearly reveals his satisfaction, and the grin slowly becoming more prominent aligns with the concept of smiling. It can be inferred that Albert's grin or smile is the result of the conversation or the prospect potentially presented to him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(CNN) -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will not be reinstated as head of state, an overwhelming majority of the Honduran congress voted Wednesday. In an hours-long process, 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return Zelaya to office. A majority of 65 votes in the 128-member body was required to reject his reinstatement. Zelaya was removed from office in a military-led coup on June 28 and replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. On Wednesday, lawmakers voted one by one and addressed the chamber as they cast their vote, making for a slow process. The vote was a key part of a U.S.-brokered pact that representatives for Zelaya and Micheletti signed October 29, giving Congress the power to decide Zelaya's fate. The United States expressed disappointment Thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in Honduras. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela continued to call on the Honduran government to allow Zelaya's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month. \\"We are disappointed by this decision since the United States had hoped the [Honduran] Congress would have approved his return,\\" Valenzuela said in a conference call with journalists in Washington. \\"Our policy since June 28 has been consistently principled. It has condemned the coup d'etat and continued to accept President Zelaya as the democratically elected and legitimate leader of Honduras throughout this political crisis.\\" The United States continues to call for Honduras to engage in national reconciliation and creation of a truth commission to investigate the crisis, in addition to the unity government. \\"The absence of democratic, constitutional order is the unacceptable status quo,\\" a senior U.S. administration official said on the conference call, remaining anonymous under the ground rules of the call and because of the sensitivity of the situation. \\"The election is a step toward a day where Honduras will have an electorally legitimate government in place.\\"  Question: \\"Out of the 128-member body, how many lawmakers voted not to return Zelaya to office?\\" Response: \\"132\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Is \\"Mīmāṃsākas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly prescribe the proper, correct and right.\\" the correct answer? Options: A). yes B). no","output":"B). No The Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy, also known as Purva Mimamsa, primarily emphasizes the interpretation, understanding, and application of sacred texts, especially the Vedas. The Vedas consist of four main collections: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. While the Mīmāṃsākas certainly value the clarity and precision of language, their main focus is on the specific sections of the Vedas, particularly the rituals and duties prescribed in the Karma Kanda.  Karma Kanda is the section of the Vedas which deals with ritual action, sacrificial rites, and the performance of duties. It is divided into three parts: Samhitas, or hymns and mantras; Brahmanas, which are commentaries on the rituals in the Samhitas; and the Aranyakas, which are contemplative writings related to the previous two sections. Purva Mimamsa is primarily concerned with analyzing and interpreting the meaning and purpose of the ritual and ethical injunctions found in these sections. Mīmāṃsākas are also known for their philosophical inquiry and deep investigation into the Vedas. This school of thought outlines specific methods and principles for interpreting the text, known as Mimamsa Sutras, which was compiled by the ancient scholar Jaimini. These principles serve as a guide for understanding and implementing the correct conduct, rituals, and sacrifices prescribed in the Vedas. Their focus is largely on observing the specific rituals and duties, rather than seeking the divine or metaphysical truths within the texts.  Their interpretation and methods are characterized by a strong emphasis on Dharma (duties and moral order), the power of rituals and actions, and the crucial role of language and grammar in understanding and applying the Vedic texts. While Mīmāṃsākas do consider the purpose and power of language to prescribe the proper, correct, and right way of actions, the answer cannot be reduced to just the statement provided. Their emphasis is more comprehensive, revolving around the proper interpretation of the texts, understanding the prescribed rituals, and adhering to the duties enshrined in the Karma Kanda sections of the Vedas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Only Umayyad ruler (Caliphs of Damascus), Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, is unanimously praised by Sunni sources for his devout piety and justice. In his efforts to spread Islam he established liberties for the Mawali by abolishing the jizya tax for converts to Islam. Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam stated that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz also stopped the personal allowance offered to his relatives stating that he could only give them an allowance if he gave an allowance to everyone else in the empire. Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was later poisoned in the year 720. When successive governments tried to reverse Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz's tax policies it created rebellion. What was Umar ibn Ad al-Aziz's cause of death?","output":"Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, also known as Umar II, was the Umayyad caliph who ruled from 717 to 720 CE. He is indeed well-known for his piety, justice, and efforts to spread Islam while making it more equitable for converts and non-Arab Muslims. As mentioned in your question, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz's cause of death is often attributed to poisoning. This belief is based on historical accounts, which suggest that certain members of the Umayyad dynasty and other influential figures within the empire were not pleased with his reforms, particularly those that affected their wealth and power. These individuals were likely motivated to eliminate Umar II in an attempt to restore the former policies and maintain their status. There is no concrete evidence to corroborate the claim that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was indeed poisoned, as the specific details of his death remain uncertain. However, his sudden demise at a relatively young age, coupled with the political context and the discontent among the elites surrounding his policies, has led many historians to accept poisoning as the probable cause of his death. This tragic event marked the end of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz's reign and paved the way for a series of Umayyad rulers who largely overturned his reforms. The aftermath of his death saw uprisings and revolts both due to dissatisfaction with the reversal of his tax policies and a broader sense of unrest within the empire. His passing and the subsequent political turmoil eventually contributed to the decline and eventual fall of the Umayyad dynasty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this case, the mode of transportation is in the form of a sea vessel, specifically a Natick-class large district harbor tug called USS Massapequa (YTB-807), which was used by the United States Navy.  Named after the town of Massapequa in New York, the purpose of such tugs usually include moving or assisting the movement of other larger vessels such as warships and other naval vessels which may not be able to navigate through narrow waterways or enter certain ports. The tugboat thus acts as a vital component of naval logistics, assisting in re-fuelling, re-supplying and repair operations for other vessels.

They were used for their pulling power and maneuvering capabilities and were named after American Indian tribes, signifying their importance and the respect commanded by their functionality.

Context: The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) and the European E-Commerce Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \\"mere conduit\\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.","output":"The problem that mere conduit causes is that it creates a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement.

Review: I stumbled upon this one night on cable tv and was immediately hooked. This is such a great story, it has everything, love, hate, betrayl, action, etc. The costumes and scenery are fantastic. It tells the story of a boy born into slavery but is determined to get out it. He has two good friends, one is also a slave, the other is the son of a merchant. These three remain friends all throught their lives. This story kept me interested from the first episode all the way to the last. There are lots of twists and turns in the plot, when I was absolutely positively sure something was going to happen, it didn't. Plan to spend a lot of time in front of the tv once you start watching. This is a great film to watch either by yourself or with a bunch of friends. I wish hollyood would take some cues from these korean dramas.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 1012 + 1053 = -9*d + 1912 for d.","output":"Alright! Let's solve this math problem step by step. First, we will add the numbers 1012 and 1053 together. Here's how it looks:   1012 +1053 ======   2065 So, 1012 + 1053 equals 2065. Our equation now looks like this: 2065 = -9*d + 1912. Now, we need to get \\"d\\" alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 1912 from both sides. Here's the step: 2065 - 1912 = -9*d + 1912 - 1912 When we do the subtraction, we get: 153 = -9*d Now, to find out the value of \\"d,\\" we will divide both sides of the equation by -9: 153 / -9 = (-9*d) / -9 When we divide, we find out that: -17 = d So, the value of \\"d\\" is -17."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In this task you will be given a string that only contains single digit numbers spelled out. The input string will not contain spaces between the different numbers. Your task is to return the number that the string spells out. The string will spell out each digit of the number for example '1726' will be 'oneseventwosix' instead of 'one thousand seven hundred six'. Q: twoeighteightfourfour A:","output":"Part #1: Understanding the given string format. Usage: The string \\"twoeighteightfourfour\\" is given. It contains no spaces between the spelled-out single digit numbers. The spelled-out digits are \\"two\\", \\"eight\\", \\"eight\\", \\"four\\", and \\"four.\\" This meets the criteria because the string contains single digit numbers spelled out without spaces and follows the format mentioned in the task description. Part #2: Identifying each spelled-out digit in the string. Usage: In the example \\"twoeighteightfourfour,\\" the spelled-out digits are \\"two\\", \\"eight\\", \\"eight\\", \\"four\\", and \\"four.\\" This meets the criteria because we have successfully identified all the individual spelled-out digits in the string. Part #3: Converting spelled-out digits to numerals. Usage: Convert the identified spelled-out digits from the previous step to their respective numerals. The conversions are: \\"two\\" -> 2, \\"eight\\" -> 8, \\"eight\\" -> 8, \\"four\\" -> 4, and \\"four\\" -> 4. This meets the criteria because we have converted each spelled-out digit to its corresponding numeral. Part #4: Combining the converted numerals to form the final number. Usage: Combine the converted numerals from the previous step to form the final number. In this case, the numbers are 2, 8, 8, 4, and 4. So, the final number is 28844. This meets the criteria because we have combined the numerals to form the complete number that the original string spelled out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. when do you get a step up in cost basis??","output":"A step-up in cost basis occurs in several situations, primarily when there is a change in ownership or a significant event affecting an asset or security. The step-up in cost basis adjusts the original cost basis (initial value or purchase price) to a new, higher value, which may lead to more favorable tax treatment. Let's delve into some cases when a step-up in the cost basis might occur: 1. Inheritance: The most common situation for a step-up in cost basis is when an individual inherits assets, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, following the death of the original owner. Under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, the cost basis of the inherited assets is adjusted (or \\"stepped up\\") to their fair market value (FMV) at the date of the owner's death. This can be quite advantageous for the inheritor, as it can reduce the capital gains tax liability when the assets are eventually sold. 2. Gift Tax: When an individual receives a gift, the cost basis is typically the giver's original cost basis in the asset. However, if the giver paid gift taxes on the transfer, the recipient may be allowed to step up their cost basis by a proportion of the gift taxes paid. This is done to avoid double taxation on the same asset. 3. Community Property: Some states follow community property laws, under which assets acquired during a marriage are considered jointly owned. In community property states, when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse receives a step-up in cost basis for their share of the community property to its fair market value as of the date of the first spouse's death. 4. Replacement Property: If a taxpayer sells an asset and uses the proceeds to purchase a similar or related asset, they may defer recognizing any gain on the sale under certain circumstances. This is called a like-kind exchange or a Section 1031 exchange. The replacement property assumes the cost basis of the sold property (with some adjustments), but if the taxpayer eventually sells the replacement property, they will recognize any deferred gains at that time. 5. Property Improvements: If the owner of an asset, such as real estate, makes significant permanent improvements to the property that increase its value, the cost of those improvements may step up the cost basis. This can reduce future capital gains tax owed when the property is sold. 6. Stock Splits and Mergers: If a company undergoes a stock split, reverse stock split, or merger, the cost basis of the stocks may need to be adjusted accordingly. Although these events do not automatically result in a step-up in cost basis, they can change the cost basis per share to reflect new allocation and valuation. 7. Corporate Actions: Certain corporate actions, such as a spin-off or stock dividend, may also result in an adjustment to the cost basis of the shares involved. A step-up in cost basis can have significant tax implications for individuals who own or inherit assets. The step-up rules can prevent double taxation and may help reduce the amount of capital gains tax owed when the assets are sold by the new owner. It is essential to keep good records of cost basis information and consult a tax professional to ensure accurate tax reporting and compliance with tax laws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more minimalistic microhouse.

But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10. For me, this movie rated a 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Ray Milland turns in a fabulous job as Oliver's father. But the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story, and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings, at least, not for me. I may be a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal -- I still haven't seen Barry Lyndon -- because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. The lone exception is What's Up, Doc?, in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for Barbra Streisand's goofball protagonist -- and, not coincidentally, he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure!

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.

Here, we have a total of 8 inner lists with varying lengths, containing both negative and positive integers. Part #2: Multiply even numbers in each inner list. Usage: For each inner list, multiply the even numbers together. Example: In the inner list [17, 21, -14, 32], the even numbers are -14 and 32. So the multiplication would be -14 * 32 = -448. Part #3: Handle cases with no even numbers in an inner list. Usage: If an inner list does not have any even numbers, output 0 for that list. Example: In the inner list [9, -47], there are no even numbers, so the output should be 0. Part #4: Create a list of results with the same length as the number of input inner lists.

Unfortunately, from the start, the Dolphins were unable to get anything going, as the Bills' Rian Lindell kicked a 33-yard field goal in the first quarter, while Buffalo's defense prevented Miami from getting any points throughout the first half.  In the third quarter, things only got worse, as opposing QB J. P. Losman threw a 4-yard TD pass to opposing WR Josh Reed, while Lindell booted two field goals (45 & 43-yarders).  The Dolphins finally managed to get some points as WR Chris Chambers caught a 23-yard TD pass, but Miami failed on the two-point conversion.  What made this loss even more frustrating was that Dolphins QB Daunte Culpepper got sacked seven times and fumbled twice, making Miami wonder if acquiring Culpepper was the right idea in the first place. With the loss, the Dolphins were 0-2.

It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service.

Q:Information:  - A mountain bike or mountain bicycle (abbreviated Mtn Bike, MTB; or ATB, for all-terrain bicycle) is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include suspension on the frame and fork, large knobby tires, more durable heavy duty wheels, more powerful brakes, and lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction.  - Downhill is an alpine skiing discipline. Unlike the other alpine skiing events, slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and combined, which emphasize turning and technique, downhill is more about speed. Speeds of up to are common in international competition. Athletes must have an aerodynamically efficient tuck position to minimize drag and increase speed.  - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races.  - George David Atherton , known as Gee Atherton ( born 26 February 1985 , near Salisbury , England ) is a professional racing cyclist specialising in downhill and four cross mountain bike racing , and is a multiple national champion , multiple World Cup winner , 2010 Downhill World Cup Champion , and 2010 & 2014 Downhill World Champion .  - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games).  - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland.  - Mountain bike racing (shortened MTB or ATB racing) is a competitive cycle sport held on off-road terrain. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) recognised the discipline relatively late in 1990, when it sanctioned the world championships in Durango, Colorado. The first UCI Mountain Bike World Cup series took place in 1988. Its nine-race circuit covered two continentsEurope and North Americaand was sponsored by Grundig. Cross-country racing was the only World Cup sport at this time. In 1993, a six-event downhill World Cup was introduced. In 1996, cross-country mountain biking events were added to the Olympic Games. In 2006, cross-country mountain biking events became part of the World Deaf Cycling Championships for the first time in San Francisco, USA.

Make this lower case","output":"The phrase \\"Suitable for all hair types, can be eliminated with a few brush strokes.\\" when converted to lower case would read as \\"suitable for all hair types, can be eliminated with a few brush strokes.\\" Lower case letters, also known as small letters or minuscules, provide an important contrast to upper case or majuscule letters in written language and aid in reading comprehension. Text in all upper case characters can often be interpreted as shouting when used in digital communication, hence the use of lower case letters is generally preferable in most text communication for providing a more friendly sense of communication.  In computer systems, the conversion to lower or upper case letters is done in a couple of ways. One common method is using a function to convert the text, where the function runs through each letter in the string of text, checks if it's in upper case, and if so, converts it to lower case. This can be seen with functions like \\"toLowerCase()\\" in JavaScript or \\"lower()\\" in Python which are built-in functions designed to convert all the characters in a string to lower case letters.  To keep the text clean and less aggressive, the lower case format is usually used unless necessary to emphasize a point. Many style guides prefer sentence case where the first letter of the first word and any proper nouns are capitalized, the rest of the text is in lower case.  Usually, if you want to change your text from uppercase or mixed case to lowercase on a computer or in a word processing program, you select the text and choose the option to change the case. This may be called something like \\"Change Case,\\" \\"Text Case,\\" or \\"Convert Case\\" in different software programs. It's essential to ensure a balance between lower case and upper case in text for its requirements of formal or informal use. The use of all lower case letters can sometimes lead to a lack of clarity, especially when it involves proper nouns that should be capitalized. Still, it often suits better for writing that's meant to be down-to-earth and unassuming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They \\"reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives.\\" In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole.

For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles. Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. In French lodges, for example, the line \\"As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened\\" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to \\"initiate the unenlightened\\". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy.

Context: “India is OUR country” The quote we often preach but forget to deliver. I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?

Though some believe a muzzle to be inhumane, many trainers regard it as a suitable tool for a suitable purpose, just like a dog collar or a leash. If you have trouble with your dog pursuing chickens with the intent to kill or eat them, a muzzle will make training safest for all of your animals. If your dog is especially excitable, you may want to keep him on a leash until he becomes calmer around your birds. Take him with you on your feeding chores to help him become even more accustomed to the chickens and the chickens more accustomed to him. Exercise simple commands like the compound sit-stay. You may want to practice this while entering the chicken coop to fetch your eggs, which has the added benefit of teaching your dog not to invade the boundary of the chicken coop. You can do this by rubbing down your chickens with damp cloth and putting that cloth in your dog's bed or pen. Dogs have a powerful sense of smell, so the scent of the chickens, when unfamiliar, can cause a strong reaction. While outside with your dog, you may see your chickens and/or roosters fighting. This is not especially uncommon, but can leave a valuable member of your egg laying team out of commission. With your dog on its lead, run towards the fighting animals and break up the scuffle. Once you have pulled the birds apart, practice one of your basic commands, or, if you've trained your dog in it, use the safe command. By showing your dog what to do in the event of a chicken fight, and rewarding him for helping you break it up, you will begin to teach him to run to help whenever he hears a chicken in distress. Your dog already has a keen sense of some wildlife predators, but crows and chicken hawks can be just as dangerous to younger birds and chicks as a fox. Together with your dog on his lead, shoo away crows or any other birds of prey. After you have successfully chased away the birds, praise your dog and feed him a treat. This will positively reinforce the behavior to protect chickens from birds of prey. As your dog becomes more trustworthy and proves he understands your commands and also your expectations of how he should act around your birds, you should allow him to patrol for critters. Thanks to your training in how to break up a chicken fight, he will race to the sound of a chicken in distress and help. You can't expect your canine companion to keep the chickens in line if he's out of shape. Go for regular walks, continue short, rapid fire training sessions, and show your dog he's a beloved part of your pack.

To ensure the best possible end result, using fresh sturgeon that has been kept clean and cold is highly recommended. Here's a more detailed explanation and description of the steps involved in smoking sturgeon: 1. Preparation: - Acquire fresh sturgeon that has been properly stored in a cold environment - Make sure the flesh of the sturgeon is free from any damage 2. Cleaning: - Remove the fins, tail, and scutes (bony plates covering the fish) with a sharp filleting knife - Cut open the sturgeon and remove the innards and bones, being careful not to damage the surrounding flesh - Rinse the sturgeon under cold water, making sure to clean all surfaces thoroughly 3. Brining: - In a large container, prepare a brine solution (a mixture of water, salt, and sugar) according to your preferred brining recipe - Place the cleaned sturgeon in the brine mixture, ensuring it is fully submerged - Cover the container and let the sturgeon sit in the brine in the refrigerator for 8-16 hours, depending on the size of the sturgeon and the recipe you're following 4. Drying: - Remove the sturgeon from the brine and pat it dry with clean paper towels - Place the sturgeon on a wire rack and allow air to circulate around it - Allow the sturgeon to dry completely, usually for 2-4 hours, to form a pellicle (a thin layer of proteins) on its surface 5. Smoking: - Preheat your smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions, targeting a temperature around 200-225°F (93-107°C) - Add wood chips or pellets, depending on the type of smoker you're using, to create the desired smoke levels - Place the sturgeon on the smoker rack and close the smoker lid - Maintain the smoker temperature and smoke levels throughout the process - Smoke the sturgeon for about 2-4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 140-150°F (60-66°C). This may vary depending on the thickness of the sturgeon and the desired level of smokiness. 6. Cooling and Storing: - Remove the smoked sturgeon from the smoker and let it cool to room temperature - Once cooled, refrigerate the smoked sturgeon in an airtight container or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or foil - For the best taste and texture, consume the smoked sturgeon within 5-7 days of smoking, or freeze it for longer-term storage In conclusion, ensure you use good-quality, fresh sturgeon with no damaged flesh to achieve the best results when smoking sturgeon. Proper preparation, cleaning, and the smoking process are all essential to producing deliciously smoked sturgeon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit 'Laura' - Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, for an entirely different sort of crime film. Laura was based around love, and this film is based around hate; as we watch police detective Mark Dixon, a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics, accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal; a man by the name of Tommy Scalisi. The plot is brilliantly worked, and Preminger excellently balances several plot points; but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character. The fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from, and director Otto Preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling, beating one another (and their women), shooting and more - and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier 'Laura', which was very much set in upper class society. The role of Mark Dixon gives Dana Andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career. Here, we have a character that is difficult to like as he's so cold - but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he's easy to sympathise with, and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight. The character development is well timed, and as we've follows this character and his motivations throughout the film; everything makes sense by the end. His co-star is the beautiful Gene Tierney, who isn't given as much to do in this film as she was in Laura; a film that made Tierney its linchpin. She does well with what she's got, however, and the lead duo's chemistry is excellent and Tierney helps to complete every scene she's in. I can't say that this is a better film than the earlier Laura; that's a hard act to follow, but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than Preminger's earlier film. The film also makes a good comparison piece for Laura; as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie, yet it's all strangely familiar. Highly recommended to all!

A:","output":"After immediately purchasing the birthday present once it went on sale, Robin would likely experience a range of emotions and feelings. The exact emotions would depend on various elements, such as her relationship with the birthday person, the nature of the present, and her personal values and beliefs. However, some possible emotions and feelings that Robin might experience are as follows: 1. Satisfaction: Robin may feel satisfied and content for securing the birthday present right when it went on sale. This satisfaction may come from knowing she managed to buy the gift promptly, ensuring its availability, and possibly even taking advantage of a discounted price. Furthermore, knowing she has shown consideration and thoughtfulness in selecting the gift can boost her happiness and satisfaction. 2. Relief: Purchasing the present immediately after its release can provide a sense of relief to Robin. This is because she no longer needs to worry about the gift's availability or competing with others interested in purchasing the same item. Additionally, she can now focus on other preparations or tasks related to the birthday celebration without the stress of finding the perfect gift. 3. Excitement: Robin might be excited about giving the birthday present to the recipient. This excitement may stem from the anticipation of seeing the recipient's reaction to the gift, particularly if she believes they will genuinely love or appreciate the present. The excitement can also come from imagining the recipient using or enjoying the gift, which can increase Robin's sense of happiness and well-being. 4. Curiosity: After purchasing the birthday present, Robin may experience curiosity about how the actual gift will be received and if it meets the expectations of the birthday person. She might wonder whether the recipient will like the present as much as she thinks they will and what their overall response will be. 5. Pride: If Robin managed to find a truly unique or fitting gift for the birthday person, she might feel a sense of pride in her choice. This pride may come from knowing that she made an effort to select a gift that demonstrates her understanding of the recipient's preferences, needs, and interests. In turn, this pride may increase her self-esteem and self-worth. 6. Anticipation: Finally, Robin may feel anticipation and eagerness leading up to the moment when she will give the birthday present. She might be looking forward to the celebration, enjoying the company of friends and loved ones, and experiencing the pleasure of sharing in the recipient's joy as they unwrap their gift. Of course, the intensity and combination of these emotions would vary depending on Robin's character, the specific context, and personal circumstances.

Washington (CNN)Mitt Romney told an audience of Republican donors in New York on Friday that he is seriously considering a third presidential bid. \\"Mitt told the group of 30 or so guys that were there that he is considering a run for the White House and that they could go tell their friends,\\" a source in the room told CNN. The Wall Street Journal first reported the comments. Though his loyalists and supportive donors have floated his name as a potential candidate for the better part of a year, Romney himself has been more reticent about mounting another White House bid after his 2008 and 2012 losses. But Romney's outlook has changed in recent weeks, according to people who have spoken with him recently, and he seems to be more serious than ever before. Romney has kept in close touch with his donors, many of whom have become close friends over two presidential cycles, according to one source close to Romney who was not at the meeting in New York but is familiar with his thinking. Romney hosts an annual retreat each year in Park City for policy discussions—and used the two most recent gatherings in 2013 and 2014 to introduce them to potential 2016 presidential candidates including Rand Paul and Chris Christie. (Jeb Bush was invited to speak last summer, but could not attend because of previous commitments, including his father's birthday). Many of Romney's New York donors, who are in frequent touch with him, had suggested a lunch or get-together when Romney was in New York, which resulted in the meeting with donors on Friday as he was on his way back from Charlie Baker's swearing in as the new governor of Massachusetts, this person said. Former aides to Romney have said that his thinking about the race has evolved over several months, particularly after he had time to reflect on being back on the campaign trail for the midterm races. As former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has moved toward a bid, many donors had pressed him for a signal about his level of interest. \\"He had not closed his mind on this, and today was the day that he decided to share that with the group of people he was with,\\" the source familiar with Romney's thinking said. \\"His conviction that the country is on the wrong track is very strong. He's very concerned with America's role in the world. Nothing has changed on that.\\" As far as re-entering the field for the Republican nomination, the source said, \\"He knows he would have to earn it, he knows no one is handed the nomination, but he's giving it some thought....His head hasn't changed, I think he was just formalizing it a little bit,\\" at the Friday meeting, the source said, to let donors know he was considering a bid more seriously. Romney's comments come in the wake of Jeb Bush's stepped-up political activity. Bush, Romney and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — all favorites of the Republican establishment and New York donor community — would presumably draw from the same pool of financial backers. \\"I think he is serious,\\" said the person at the New York meeting. \\"One of the first things he said he said was, 'People ask me, do you want to be president? Well, yes, I did run twice.\\" Romney said that his wife, Ann, is \\"very encouraging\\" about 2016, the source said, but his sons are split about the idea, the source who was in the room said. The source familiar with Romney's thinking also said Ann is \\"supportive of it\\" if that's what Romney wants. \\"I don't think he would have come to this without talking to his family.\\" At the heart of this, this source adds, is that \\"the state of the country hasn't settled for him. he won't be happy sitting on the sidelines.\\" The former Massachusetts governor told the crowd that a potential campaign would \\"have to have a positive message.\\" He also said, somewhat obviously, that he \\"would run a different campaign from what he's run in the past.\\" Romney entertained questions about the rest of the potential 2016 field but had only positive things to say about his would-be rivals, the source said. The news comes after a week chock-full of high-profile potential Republican presidential candidates taking the first steps toward announcing their candidacy for the 2016 election. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush launched a Leadership PAC this week, just days after resigning his position on various corporate and nonprofite boards. And former GOP presidential contender Mike Huckabee quit his show on Fox News last week to give 2016 some serious consideration. And CNN reported Wednesday that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is assembling a team for a potential 2016 presidential bid. The revelation of Romney's overtures to top GOP donors is yet another addition to the long-term game of footsy Romney has played with the media and other Republicans who would like to know whether Romney is in or out -- though it's certainly the most definitive and serious indication that Romney might actually launch a third presidential bid. Romney was rumored to be through with his presidential ambitions after a grueling 2012 run, but this summer he made several head nods that he was considering. Romney told the Washington Post this summer that \\"we'll have to see what happens\\" and said in another interview that the chances were very slim -- but conceded there was nonetheless always a chance. \\"We never say never,\\" Ann Romney said on CNN's \\"New Day\\" this summer. Gloria Borger contributed to this report. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Mitt Romney has expressed to a group of Republican donors in New York that he is seriously considering a third presidential bid.

One thing I 'll say for this house is that it has nice six - panel doors , which were originally stained a medium brown rather than painted . Unfortunately all the doorframes and the baseboards ( too narrow and too obviously off the cheap builder 's shelf to be graceful ) were stained to match , setting the whole place instantly and unmistakably in the 1980 's . What is the advantage of taping off places ?","output":"Taping off places that need to be protected during painting or staining projects is a crucial step to ensure a clean, professional outcome. This technique typically involves applying painter's tape or masking tape around edges, borders, and other areas you wish to shield from accidental paint or stain marks. The advantages of taping off places are numerous and contribute to the overall quality and appearance of the finished project. Some of these advantages include: 1. Precision: Taping off places creates a sharp, well-defined boundary between different surfaces or colors, achieving a professional and polished look. It allows for clean and straight lines, particularly when working with contrasting shades, and avoids paint or stain seeping onto unintended surfaces. 2. Protection: It serves as a barrier, shielding areas like doorframes, baseboards, window sills, and other architectural details from unwanted paint spills, drips, and brush strokes. This prevents irreversible damage to these surfaces and saves both time and effort in the clean-up process. 3. Consistent results: Taping off places ensures that you maintain a consistent finish throughout the project. It aids in achieving a uniform edge with even thickness, which is difficult to achieve without this protective barrier in place. 4. Time-saving: While it may seem like an additional step in the painting or staining process, taping off places saves you time and effort in the long run. It reduces the need for touch-ups caused by paint or stain bleeding and minimizes clean up after you complete your project. 5. Enhances overall appearance: A neatly taped-off area sets the stage for a flawless and visually appealing result. It adds finesse and attention to detail that elevates the quality of your work, making a significant difference in the final appearance. 6. Eases color transitions: When working with multiple colors or painting a feature wall, taping off places allows for seamless and smooth transitions between different shades. It ensures the colors don't bleed into one another, improving the overall visual impact. 7. Simplifies the painting process: For novice painters or DIY-enthusiasts, taping off places simplifies the process by offering a guideline to follow and a safety net for any stray brush strokes. It helps avoid unintentional mistakes, boosting your confidence in tackling painting projects. In summary, taping off places offers a multitude of advantages that contribute to a cleaner, more precise, and professional-looking result in painting or staining projects. It not only simplifies the process but also ensures a consistent and visually appealing outcome, protecting delicate surfaces and making color transitions seamless."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How many years after Portugal declared bankruptcy was the monarchy deposed elements of the armed forces\\" is \\"92\\"?","output":"Yes, the correct answer is 18 years. Portugal declared bankruptcy in 1892, and the monarchy was deposed in 1910 by elements of the armed forces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I read this background article the other day: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects.  I am facing a new situation today: Two villages had many inhabitants practicing horticulture. People from Valley village grew flowers and used arthropodes and other insects for pollination and crop protection. Granite village used arthropods and snails, they cultivated them for food.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village knew more about bee pollination? Answer:","output":"To answer the question of which village knew more about bee pollination, let's analyze the information provided and compare the two villages: 1. Valley Village: - They grew flowers. - They used arthropods and other insects for pollination and crop protection. Given that they rely on arthropods and other insects for pollination, it's likely that the inhabitants of Valley village have an understanding of bee pollination, as they recognize the importance of these pollinators in their horticulture practices. 2. Granite Village: - They used arthropods and snails. - They cultivated them for food. Although they also interact with arthropods, the purpose is different. Granite village cultivates arthropods and snails for food, which does not necessarily indicate knowledge of bee pollination, especially since pollination is not mentioned in their practices. Comparing the two villages, it seems that Valley village has a more direct connection to bee pollination due to their reliance on arthropods and other insects for pollination in their horticultural practices. Therefore, I would conclude that Valley village probably knows more about bee pollination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The...

Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays a hapless, dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil, former boss, the situation gets out of control. While Standa is genuinely (but endearingly) stupid, his buddy Ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time.

If you have no idea how the program can help you, 67 Steps reviews are the best way to get started. Don’t just dive in to buy the world-famous Tai Lopez lecture series. Like buying clothes or shoes, go window shopping first to find the best option for you to break down Tai Lopez’s success principles.      Of course, 67 Steps reviews of the Tai Lopez opus are free. But to get your hands on the real meat of the actual program, you have to pay USD 67 on a monthly basis. According to most 67 Steps reviews, such a financial investment is worth it.      However, if you’re a struggling student or unemployed, you might not be willing to commit to the Tai Lopez lecture series just yet–maybe later. For the time being, the good news is, 67 Steps reviews are all available for free online especially on YouTube. And if you start this way, chances are, you will be able to learn a lot more than diving straight into all the paid Tai Lopez videos.      To illustrate, the Tai Lopez work can be easily broken down into 67 success principles. Surely, 67 Steps reviews are enough to reveal what all the steps are, the first 10 of which are as follows:      1) Self investment      2) Adapt      3) Be humble      4) You need a trainer      5) Surround yourself with positive people      6) Hard work is the only guarantee of success      7) Mental trap is the worst trap      8) Integrate your life (friends, home, work, exercise)      9) Learn from the experience of others      10) Don’t be onion-skinned      As 67 Steps reviews will tell you, there are 57 more steps to follow where each step can be a one-hour video.

For the Tai Lopez videos to really make a difference in your life, you need to treat them like you would a new fitness routine. Like Tai Lopez himself, you need to walk the talk.      As many 67 Steps reviews attest, Tai Lopez did not become rich overnight if he did not put all 67 principles of success to work for him. His success formula is based on years of poring through all books written by geniuses, visionary entrepreneurs, spiritual leaders, and motivational speakers. An alternative to mimicking the Tai Lopez success principles is to get your hands on all the books that he has read.      So in effect, Tai Lopez is saving you time and money by doing all the research himself. He has condensed all the gems of wisdom from the greatest thinkers of the human species. In addition, he gives precious examples of how the success principles he has unearthed work for him in real life.

For even if you spend your time on just the reviews themselves, you can already cover a great deal to put yourself on the path of success.

No doubt, many more 67 Steps reviews are coming your way courtesy of the information superhighway. Having fun with them merely demonstrates the principle that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. And that goes for Jill as well. ||||| By Daryn Kagan , Contributing Writer      About five months ago, Ryan Garcia’s world changed forever.      He and his wife, Lindsey, became first-time parents to Isla Quinn.      “She’s gorgeous!” he gushed to me the other day.      So what’s the big deal, you might ask? Millions of men become fathers every year. Ah, but this new dad has let the love for his daughter inspire a revolution. A kindness revolution.      “I was sitting on my couch at the end of the year,” he remembers, “thinking about New Year’s resolutions. Should I try to lose weight? Do something else predictable?”      He looked over at his sweet baby girl and inspiration hit him. “I decided I wanted to do something that would inspire her in the future. I wanted to be a better person.”      That’s how 2012 became his year of random acts of kindness. Each day for this calendar year, he’s committed to doing something nice for someone else. Sometimes, it’s for people he knows.      “I tracked down my sixth-grade teacher, Mr. Plecas,” he said, “and wrote him a letter thanking him for being my favorite teacher ever. He had a way of making learning fun. I’ll never forget him, and he needed to know that.”      Ryan has also sent a letter to a family who lost their son while he was serving in Afghanistan. “I wanted to send my condolences and thank them for everything their family has sacrificed, he explained.      There have been funny days, too. Like the time he made a point to compliment 25 total strangers. That was as great as the day he stood on the corner and offered free hugs.      If it sounds like quite the journey, it is. Ryan is sharing his kind acts with the world on this blog, 366randomacts.org (online at 366randomacts.org). He invites you to follow along. You can also find him on Facebook and Twitter. In fact, for every “like” and “follower” he gets, he’s donating a dime to charity.      This giving thing has a way of growing. Ryan figures it’s the least he can do. “I never meant to do any of this for me,” he says. “I just can’t believe how much I’m getting out of it. The little bit of kindness I put out seems to multiply the way it comes back to me.”      “And what about Baby Isla?” I ask. “She’s too young to appreciate her dad doing any of this.”      “That’s the main reason I’m doing the blog,” he says. “When she’s old enough, she’ll see all the stories, photos and videos. She’ll see how she inspired one man to become a better person.”      This kindness streak is such a fun ride, Ryan is suggesting you try it out for yourself.      “You know what people will say to that,” I offer, “it’s nice for this guy, but I’m way too busy to fit all this in.”      “No one is busier than I am,” he counters. “I’ve got a newborn, a demanding full-time job, groups I belong to, and I work out. I’ve found out that being nice doesn’t take extra time.”      So are you in? If your ride is anything like Ryan’s, sounds like putting a little kindness out there will take you places you never imagined.      Daryn Kagan is the creator of DarynKagan.com.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Ensuring you are eating a balanced diet at regular intervals throughout the day can help prevent or reduce the pain associated with your period.  A well-balanced diet includes whole grains, legumes, vegetables and fruit.  Foods that are rich in complex carbohydrates can also be helpful as they help your body produce more serotonin, which in turn helps to regulate your mood and symptoms. Additional foods to consider are: nuts and seeds, almonds, buckwheat, millet, oats, sesame and sunflower seeds, blackstrap molasses, grapes and red beets.  In addition to eating the proper foods, you may want to try eating six smaller meals throughout the day, instead of three larger ones.  Spreading out your food intake can help keep your blood sugar levels balanced, which in turn can help alleviate many symptoms associated with your period, including pain and cramps.  When cooking, using healthy oils like vegetable or olive oil. Glycemic load is based on the glycemic index.  The glycemic index is used to rank foods based on how quickly they work their way through your digestive system and how quickly they get absorbed into your bloodstream.  Eating foods with a low glycemic load means they take longer to work their way through your digestive system and do not cause spikes in your blood sugar levels.  Examples of food with a low glycemic load include: whole grain bread, apples, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, watermelons, carrots, lentils, peas, and soybeans. Examples of food with a high glycemic load include: white bagels, cornflakes, baked potatoes, and sweet potatoes. You can find more information and search where specific foods fall on the glycemic index at this website: http://www.glycemicindex.com/ Foods that contain large amounts of fat, along with highly processed foods, should be avoided.  In addition, it is also helpful to reduce the amount of sodium you consume.  Foods that contain all of these items can make the pain associated with your period (and other PMS symptoms) worse. It is also best to eliminate the intake of any foods that contain trans-fats.  Trans-fats are normally found in commercially produced foods such as: cookies, crackers, cakes, french fries, onion rings, donuts, and margarine. In the days leading up to your period, you should try to reduce the amount of alcohol you consume.  Alcohol has the ability to make the pain associated with your period (and other PMS symptoms) worse. Beverages and foods containing caffeine can worsen cramps and bloating. Caffeine can cause blood vessels to constrict and cramp more than they do in those who avoid caffeine. Cut out coffee and caffeinated tea the week before your period. Sometimes the pain associated with a woman’s period, including many of the symptoms associated with PMS, can be made worse by stress, anxiety and overall tension in the body.  Implementing techniques to help you relax and relieve stress can help reduce or eliminate your painful symptoms.  Relaxation techniques can include: breathing exercises, meditation and yoga.  Attending a yoga class via a local yoga studio or recreation centre can also help you learn proper breathing methods and meditation techniques. Massage is another great way to help reduce tension and increase relaxation.  Scheduling a regular massage right before or during your period every month may help you manage the pain. There is an acupressure point located on the inside of your leg, approximately three finger widths up from your anklebone, that can create relief for cramps and pain caused by your period.  Use your fingers to apply deep pressure to this area for five minutes to help relieve the pain. Applying pressure and massaging your lower abdomen, where the cramps are most painful, may also help.  You might want to try this in combination with a heating pad. The change in hormone levels just before your period can often cause severe headaches and even migraines.  One way to help relieve the pain caused by these headaches is to apply a cold cloth or ice pack to your head or neck — wherever the pain is most prominent. If you decide to use an ice pack, or ice cubes, be sure to wrap it in a towel first. Avoid applying ice-cold items directly to your skin, as this can cause irritation or damage. Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but it can also help relieve cramps and other pain caused by your period.  Two types of exercise that are most effective is yoga and aerobic exercises. Try to exercise for 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week. A warm bath (or shower) or a heating pad can help reduce the severity of the cramps caused by your period.  The heating pad can be placed on your belly, below your belly button. Be careful not to fall asleep with a heating pad on.  If possible, purchase a heating pad that automatically turns itself off after a certain period of time. Summary:","output":"To prevent or reduce period pain, maintain a balanced diet with whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and complex carbohydrates, while consuming six smaller meals throughout the day. Focus on low glycemic load foods and avoid high-fat and processed foods, reducing sodium and trans-fat intake. Minimize alcohol and caffeine consumption before your period. Manage stress and anxiety through relaxation techniques, yoga, and massage. Apply acupressure and massage to relieve cramps, use a cold cloth or ice pack for headaches, and engage in regular exercise. Finally, use heating pads or take warm baths to alleviate cramps, but be cautious with heating pad use while sleeping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Today, we are going to learn how to pronounce a new word by taking it apart and putting it back together. This will help us say it correctly and have fun while doing it! First, let's start by breaking the word into smaller parts. Like how we build with our favorite toy blocks, we can break words down into smaller pieces to make it easier for us to learn. So, we have a word that has two parts: \\"o-\\" and \\"-nee-.\\" Let's learn how to say these two parts first, and then we can put them back together like a puzzle. To pronounce the first part \\"o-\\", we should make a round shape with our mouth, like a little circle. Then, let the sound come through our mouth and it will sound like 'oh.' Now, let's move on to the second part: \\"-nee-.\\" For this part, you need to press your lips together gently and let the sound flow through your nose. It will sound like 'knee,' just like the part of your leg that bends when you walk. Great job! Now we are ready to add one more sound to complete our word. The sound we need to add is \\"sa.\\" To pronounce \\"sa,\\" we need to open our mouths a little bit and let the air flow smoothly while making a soft sound with an 's' and then an 'a.' It will sound like 'sah.' Now here comes the fun part, let's put it all together! Like putting pieces of a puzzle together, we need to connect the first part \\"o-\\", the second part \\"-nee-,\\" and our final sound, \\"sa.\\" When we put them together, we get the word \\"o-nee-sa.\\" Congratulations, you just learned how to pronounce a new word! Keep practicing this word and other new words by breaking them down into smaller parts and putting them back together. This way, you will become a super word builder, and soon, you'll be able to read, speak, and understand so many more words.

But can you believe that a school in England is using classical music to cut down students' bad behavior? The head teacher Brian Walker at the West Park School in Derby asks some students to stay behind after school on Fridays. He forces his students to listen to Mozart and other classical music. He also makes them copy his favorite poems and they have to watch educational videos. Mr. Walker says his main aim is to stop noisy pupils causing trouble in class for students who want to study. He said the students staying behind were \\"not the smokers or drinkers, the truants   or the people who are late for school...It's those who have slowed the learning and teaching in class for everyone\\".

Answer:","output":"The real name of the criminal known as 'The Monster of Dusseldorf' was Peter Kürten. Born on May 26, 1883, in Mülheim am Rhein, Germany, Peter Kürten was a notorious serial killer and rapist who terrorized the city of Dusseldorf during the 1920s and 1930s. Kürten grew up in an impoverished, abusive household, which is believed to have greatly influenced his deviant and violent behavior later in life. As a child, he was subjected to the violent tendencies of his father, who routinely abused his wife and children. This harsh upbringing likely contributed to Kürten's violent tendencies and sadistic nature that would later define him as 'The Monster of Dusseldorf.' His first recorded criminal activity began at a young age, with various petty crimes and acts of animal abuse. Soon after, his pattern of criminality escalated, and he moved on to more violent and gruesome acts such as arson, burglary, theft, and vandalism. As Kürten grew older, his criminal offenses evolved into a series of shocking murders, sexual assaults, and vicious attacks. His main motivation behind these crimes was not only the fulfillment of his own sadistic desires but also the infliction of extreme pain and suffering on his victims. Kürten committed most of his murders during 1929, and his victims ranged from women to young girls and even men. He used various methods to kill, including strangulation, stabbing, and bludgeoning. Oftentimes, Kürten would sexually assault his victims before or after the act of murder, further showcasing his deviant and sadistic nature. He earned the nickname 'The Monster of Dusseldorf' due to the terror he instilled in the city of Dusseldorf, as well as the brutality of his crimes. His choice of victims and the violent nature of his crimes made it difficult for the police to apprehend him, as there seemed to be no specific pattern to his crimes. However, Kürten ultimately confessed many of his crimes to his wife, who, in turn, reported him to the authorities. He was arrested on May 24, 1930. During his trial, Peter Kürten showed no remorse and provided chilling details about his crimes. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by beheading. On July 2, 1931, Kürten was executed by guillotine in Cologne, Germany. 'The Monster of Dusseldorf' will forever be remembered as one of Germany's most notorious and terrifying serial killers."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The attacks reminded the world once again how brazen the group can be. What does Al-Shabaab want? Here's an explainer. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that the United States designated as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008.

Explanation:  The correct answer should be the \\"Kenyan government\\" because the sentence before the gap tells us about attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya blamed on Al-Shabaab. It implies that the government of Kenya would respond to these attacks. The other options are not logical. For example, Al-Shabaab is a terrorist group and does not govern, CNN and the Council on Foreign Relations are news organizations, not governments. The U.S. or the United States government was not mentioned in this context, and Somalia would not likely order an incursion into its own territory.

Information:  - Lad tiden gå ( English : Let time pass ) is a 1986 science fiction novel by Danish modernist writer Svend Aage Madsen . The novel focuses on one of the central themes in Madsen 's writing - the nature of time . Like most of Madsen 's novels it has n't been published in English . This novel is a typical example of the third phase in Madsen 's writing that 's like most of his later works is set in the town of Aarhus and has several characters that also appear in his other books ( Johanna , Sverre ) . It also has another typical feature of Madsen 's books - a complicated timeline of the novel having chapters describing overlapping periods of time .  - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.  - Svend Åge Madsen (born 2 November 1939) is a Danish novelist. He studied mathematics before he began writing fiction. His novels are generally philosophical and humorous. Several of his works have been made into films in Denmark. His writings are extensive and has been translated into many languages.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'let time pass' with the relationship of 'country of origin'.  Choices: - ancient greece  - denmark Answer:","output":"The best answer for the entity that is related to 'let time pass' with the relationship of 'country of origin' is Denmark.  Reasoning: this connection is made clear through the information outlined in the provided texts. 'Let time pass' (or 'Lad tiden gå' in Danish) is identified as a science fiction novel written by Svend Aage Madsen in 1986. The text specifies that Svend Aage Madsen is a modernist writer from Denmark. Hence, considering the 'country of origin' in the context of the novel 'Let time pass', Denmark is identified as the correct answer. This connection would not be Ancient Greece because, while Ancient Greece does play a role in the history of the development of language and has philosophers who debated about the origin of language, it doesn't have a direct relation to the novel 'Let time pass.' In summary, the Danish origin of the novel 'Let time pass' is evident through the Danish nationality of its author, Svend Aage Madsen. Therefore, Denmark is the 'country of origin' related to 'Let time pass.' This reasoning eliminates the option of Ancient Greece as the correct answer because it lacks a direct association with this novel, regardless of its considerable contribution to language development and philosophical discussions about language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Title: Strangers on a Train Movie plot: Criss-crossing railroad tracks are an image used in the film Amateur tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) wants to marry Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), the daughter of a senator, and pursue a political career. First, he must divorce his vulgar and promiscuous wife Miriam (Laura Elliott). On a train, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) recognizes Guy and knows about his marital situation from the gossip pages. Bruno introduces himself, then proposes an idea for the perfect homicide: he and Guy should \\"swap murders\\". Bruno will murder Miriam, and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno's despised father. Each would be killing a stranger. Having no identifiable motive for the crimes, neither would be suspects. Guy humors Bruno's absurd murder plot by pretending to find it amusing. Bruno interprets this as agreement to the scheme. Bruno then borrows Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter and slips it into his own pocket. Guy meets with Miriam. Pregnant by someone else, she now refuses to give Guy a divorce and threatens to cause a scandal. Guy relays the bad news to Anne, metaphorically commenting that he would like to \\"strangle\\" Miriam. Meanwhile, Bruno stalks Miriam through an amusement park and fatally strangles her on the \\"Magic Isle\\". Bruno then informs Guy that Miriam is dead, and expects him to follow through on murdering Bruno's father. Bruno sends Guy his house key, a map to his father's bedroom, and a pistol. When the police question Guy about Miriam's death, he claims he was on a train at the time of the murder. The police determine his alibi is inconclusive because he could have left the train in time to commit the murder and continued his trip on another train. Guy is not arrested, but the police assign an officer to trail him to ensure he does not flee while they investigate. To pressure Guy into fulfilling his obligation, Bruno introduces himself to Anne and meets Anne's younger sister, Barbara (Patricia Hitchcock), who physically resembles Miriam.

File photo      The ashes of cremated Catholics cannot be kept at home, scattered or divided among family members, the Vatican has announced in new guidelines.      The two-page instruction by the Vatican's department on doctrine said ashes of the dead must be kept in \\"sacred places\\" such as cemeteries.      It also stressed that the Roman Catholic Church still preferred burials over cremations.      The Vatican allowed cremation in 1963 but has always frowned on the practice.      It also stressed at the time that cremation must not suggest a denial of faith about resurrection.      Countering 'new ideas'      \\"It is not permitted to scatter the ashes of the faithful departed in the air, on land, at sea or in some other way, nor may they be preserved in mementos, pieces of jewellery or other objects,\\" said the instruction by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.      \\"These courses of action cannot be legitimised by an appeal to the sanitary, social, or economic motives that may have occasioned the choice of cremation.\\"      The Vatican said it was issuing the new guidelines to counter \\"new ideas contrary to the Church's faith\\" that had become widespread since 1963.      It said the Church could not \\"condone attitudes or permit rites that involve erroneous ideas about death, such as considering death as the definitive annihilation of the person, or the moment of fusion with Mother Nature or the universe, or as a stage in the cycle of regeneration, or as the definitive liberation from the 'prison' of the body\\".      The guidelines reiterated that Catholics who chose to be cremated \\"for reasons contrary to the Christian faith\\" must be denied a Christian funeral.      The Vatican also stressed that \\"the Church continues to prefer the practice of burying the bodies of the deceased, because this shows a greater esteem towards the deceased\\".      Pope Francis had already approved the guidelines, the Vatican said.      Shortage of burial land fears - BBC's Religious Affairs correspondent Martin Bashir      Fearing the impact of naturalistic ideas about the circle of life, where the body is regarded as no different to other physical matter, the Vatican has decided to clarify its position on what should happen to the remains of the dead.      Cardinal Gerhard Muller, the head of the Church's powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said ashes of those cremated should be committed to a cemetery or another consecrated place.      But Britain and some other western countries face a shortage of land in which to bury bodies.      There are concerns this announcement will not only place financial burdens on Catholic families but also increase the pressure on cemeteries, half of which are expected to run out of space within the next 20 years. ||||| CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH      Instruction Ad resurgendum cum Christo      regarding the burial of the deceased      and the conservation of the ashes in the case of cremation      1. To rise with Christ, we must die with Christ: we must “be away from the body and at home with the Lord” (2 Cor 5:8). With the Instruction Piam et Constantem of 5 July 1963, the then Holy Office established that “all necessary measures must be taken to preserve the practice of reverently burying the faithful departed”, adding however that cremation is not “opposed per se to the Christian religion” and that no longer should the sacraments and funeral rites be denied to those who have asked that they be cremated, under the condition that this choice has not been made through “a denial of Christian dogmas, the animosity of a secret society, or hatred of the Catholic religion and the Church”.[1] Later this change in ecclesiastical discipline was incorporated into the Code of Canon Law (1983) and the Code of Canons of Oriental Churches (1990).      During the intervening years, the practice of cremation has notably increased in many countries, but simultaneously new ideas contrary to the Church’s faith have also become widespread. Having consulted the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts and numerous Episcopal Conferences and Synods of Bishops of the Oriental Churches, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has deemed opportune the publication of a new Instruction, with the intention of underlining the doctrinal and pastoral reasons for the preference of the burial of the remains of the faithful and to set out norms pertaining to the conservation of ashes in the case of cremation.      2. The resurrection of Jesus is the culminating truth of the Christian faith, preached as an essential part of the Paschal Mystery from the very beginnings of Christianity: “For I handed on to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures; that he was buried; that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures; that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve” (1 Cor 15:3-5).      Through his death and resurrection, Christ freed us from sin and gave us access to a new life, “so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life” (Rm 6:4). Furthermore, the risen Christ is the principle and source of our future resurrection: “Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep […] For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Cor 15:20-22).      It is true that Christ will raise us up on the last day; but it is also true that, in a certain way, we have already risen with Christ. In Baptism, actually, we are immersed in the death and resurrection of Christ and sacramentally assimilated to him: “You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead” (Col 2:12). United with Christ by Baptism, we already truly participate in the life of the risen Christ (cf. Eph 2:6).      Because of Christ, Christian death has a positive meaning. The Christian vision of death receives privileged expression in the liturgy of the Church: “Indeed for your faithful, Lord, life is changed not ended, and, when this earthly dwelling turns to dust, an eternal dwelling is made ready for them in heaven”.[2] By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our body, transformed by reunion with our soul. In our own day also, the Church is called to proclaim her faith in the resurrection: “The confidence of Christians is the resurrection of the dead; believing this we live”.[3]      3. Following the most ancient Christian tradition, the Church insistently recommends that the bodies of the deceased be buried in cemeteries or other sacred places.[4]      In memory of the death, burial and resurrection of the Lord, the mystery that illumines the Christian meaning of death,[5] burial is above all the most fitting way to express faith and hope in the resurrection of the body.[6]      The Church who, as Mother, has accompanied the Christian during his earthly pilgrimage, offers to the Father, in Christ, the child of her grace, and she commits to the earth, in hope, the seed of the body that will rise in glory.[7]      By burying the bodies of the faithful, the Church confirms her faith in the resurrection of the body,[8] and intends to show the great dignity of the human body as an integral part of the human person whose body forms part of their identity.[9] She cannot, therefore, condone attitudes or permit rites that involve erroneous ideas about death, such as considering death as the definitive annihilation of the person, or the moment of fusion with Mother Nature or the universe, or as a stage in the cycle of regeneration, or as the definitive liberation from the “prison” of the body.      Furthermore, burial in a cemetery or another sacred place adequately corresponds to the piety and respect owed to the bodies of the faithful departed who through Baptism have become temples of the Holy Spirit and in which “as instruments and vessels the Spirit has carried out so many good works”.[10]      Tobias, the just, was praised for the merits he acquired in the sight of God for having buried the dead,[11] and the Church considers the burial of dead one of the corporal works of mercy.[12]      Finally, the burial of the faithful departed in cemeteries or other sacred places encourages family members and the whole Christian community to pray for and remember the dead, while at the same time fostering the veneration of martyrs and saints.      Through the practice of burying the dead in cemeteries, in churches or their environs, Christian tradition has upheld the relationship between the living and the dead and has opposed any tendency to minimize, or relegate to the purely private sphere, the event of death and the meaning it has for Christians.      4. In circumstances when cremation is chosen because of sanitary, economic or social considerations, this choice must never violate the explicitly-stated or the reasonably inferable wishes of the deceased faithful. The Church raises no doctrinal objections to this practice, since cremation of the deceased’s body does not affect his or her soul, nor does it prevent God, in his omnipotence, from raising up the deceased body to new life. Thus cremation, in and of itself, objectively negates neither the Christian doctrine of the soul’s immortality nor that of the resurrection of the body.[13]      The Church continues to prefer the practice of burying the bodies of the deceased, because this shows a greater esteem towards the deceased. Nevertheless, cremation is not prohibited, “unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine”.[14]      In the absence of motives contrary to Christian doctrine, the Church, after the celebration of the funeral rite, accompanies the choice of cremation, providing the relevant liturgical and pastoral directives, and taking particular care to avoid every form of scandal or the appearance of religious indifferentism.      5. When, for legitimate motives, cremation of the body has been chosen, the ashes of the faithful must be laid to rest in a sacred place, that is, in a cemetery or, in certain cases, in a church or an area, which has been set aside for this purpose, and so dedicated by the competent ecclesial authority.      From the earliest times, Christians have desired that the faithful departed become the objects of the Christian community’s prayers and remembrance. Their tombs have become places of prayer, remembrance and reflection. The faithful departed remain part of the Church who believes “in the communion of all the faithful of Christ, those who are pilgrims on earth, the dead who are being purified, and the blessed in heaven, all together forming one Church”.[15]      The reservation of the ashes of the departed in a sacred place ensures that they are not excluded from the prayers and remembrance of their family or the Christian community. It prevents the faithful departed from being forgotten, or their remains from being shown a lack of respect, which eventuality is possible, most especially once the immediately subsequent generation has too passed away. Also it prevents any unfitting or superstitious practices.      6. For the reasons given above, the conservation of the ashes of the departed in a domestic residence is not permitted. Only in grave and exceptional cases dependent on cultural conditions of a localized nature, may the Ordinary, in agreement with the Episcopal Conference or the Synod of Bishops of the Oriental Churches, concede permission for the conservation of the ashes of the departed in a domestic residence. Nonetheless, the ashes may not be divided among various family members and due respect must be maintained regarding the circumstances of such a conservation.      7. In order that every appearance of pantheism, naturalism or nihilism be avoided, it is not permitted to scatter the ashes of the faithful departed in the air, on land, at sea or in some other way, nor may they be preserved in mementos, pieces of jewelry or other objects. These courses of action cannot be legitimized by an appeal to the sanitary, social, or economic motives that may have occasioned the choice of cremation.      8. When the deceased notoriously has requested cremation and the scattering of their ashes for reasons contrary to the Christian faith, a Christian funeral must be denied to that person according to the norms of the law.[16]      The Sovereign Pontiff Francis, in the Audience granted to the undersigned Cardinal Prefect on 18 March 2016, approved the present Instruction, adopted in the Ordinary Session of this Congregation on 2 March 2016, and ordered its publication.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov (; Russian: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, pronounced [vla'djimjIr na'bok@f] ( listen), also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin; 22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1899 - 2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist, translator and entomologist. Nabokov was a classical liberal, in the tradition of his father, a liberal statesman who served in the Provisional Government following the February Revolution of 1917. Nabokov was a self-proclaimed \\"White Russian\\", and was, from its inception, a strong opponent of the Soviet government that came to power following the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. In a poem he wrote as a teenager in 1917, he described Lenin's Bolsheviks as \\"grey rag-tag people\\".  Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism and fascism.  Nabokov's father Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov was the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the Russian Empire, continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under Tsar Alexander II had successfully blocked anti-semitic measures from being passed by the Interior Minister. That family strain would continue in Vladimir Nabokov, who fiercely denounced anti-semitism in his writings, and in the 1930s Nabokov was able to escape Hitler's Germany only with the help of Russian Jewish emigres who still had grateful memories of his family's defense of Jews in Tsarist times.  When asked, in 1969, whether he would like to revisit the land he had fled in 1918, now the Soviet Union, he replied: \\"There's nothing to look at. New tenement houses and old churches do not interest me. The hotels there are terrible. I detest the Soviet theater. Any palace in Italy is superior to the repainted abodes of the Tsars. The village huts in the forbidden hinterland are as dismally poor as ever, and the wretched peasant flogs his wretched cart horse with the same wretched zest. As to my special northern landscape and the haunts of my childhood - well, I would not wish to contaminate their images preserved in my mind.\\" Did he write about politics?","output":"Yes, Vladimir Nabokov did write about politics. In the provided text, it is mentioned that \\"Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism and fascism.\\" So, Nabokov was engaged with political topics in his writings, particularly in expressing his opposition to various forms of authoritarianism and defending the rights of Jewish people."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

By Lillian Radulova and Aap Tony Abbott's government continues to languish behind the Labor Opposition, with the latest Newspoll showing the public would turf the government out in a landslide if an election was held today. The Newspoll, published in today's  The Australian, shows that despite a tiny one per cent gain in the Coalition's primary vote in the last fortnight, Tony Abbott's government remains deeply unpopular with the electorate. The government's fortunes took a turn for the worst with the release of the May 13 Budget, which included cuts to welfare spending, schools and hospitals. When elected in September, the Coalition's primary vote was 45.6 per cent, but now it has fallen to just 36 per cent.

In order to analyze this article and draw insights, we can break it down step by step: Step 1: Identify the main points of the article - The latest Newspoll results indicate that Tony Abbott's government remains unpopular with the electorate. - The Coalition's primary vote has decreased since September, while Labor's has increased. - The May 13 Budget seems to be a major contributor to the government's decline in popularity. - Bill Shorten is currently more preferred as Prime Minister. Step 2: Analyze possible reasons for the current situation - The May 13 Budget contained controversial measures, including cuts to welfare spending, schools, and hospitals, which could have contributed to the decline in the Coalition's popularity. - The Labor Opposition, led by Bill Shorten, may be perceived as a better alternative by the general public. Step 3: Consider possible outcomes if the current situation continues - If the Coalition's decline in popularity continues and an election is held soon, the Labor Opposition could potentially win in a landslide victory. - The Coalition might need to reevaluate policy decisions and strategies if it seeks to regain electoral support. Step 4: Reflect on the potential impacts for both parties involved - For the Coalition, this could mean significant loss of power, potentially leading to policy changes or even leadership changes. - For the Labor Opposition, a win could provide them the opportunity to implement their agenda and gain political power in Australia. Step 5: Consider possible ways to address the issue for the current government - The Coalition could attempt to address the issues driving their decline in popularity, which likely includes the controversial budget decisions. - The government could also consider improving its communication strategy to create a more positive image and reconnect with the electorate."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Question: suppose more children become teenagers happens, how will it affect less adults have children.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: Less When more children become teenagers, it indicates an increase in the younger population reaching adolescence. This could lead to various factors that affect the decision of adults (including teenage adults) to have children. These factors could include: 1. Socioeconomic factors: With a larger teenager population, there might be increased competition for resources like education and job opportunities. This in turn could lead to more people delaying starting families due to financial constraints or prioritization of their careers. 2. Changes in attitudes and values: As more people enter into the adolescent phase, the likelihood of shifts in societal values and attitudes about family planning and parenthood may increase. This could result in more adults questioning the need to have children, further contributing to less adults having children. 3. Strain on public resources: With an ever-growing teenage population, essential services such as healthcare and education could become strained, making it difficult for prospective parents to access the resources necessary for having and raising children. However, it's important to note that different societies and countries will have varying responses to these challenges. Despite these factors potentially leading to fewer adults having children in the short term, long-term effects will depend on how these societies and individuals adapt and address the challenges presented by a larger adolescent population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which town had more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds?  Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.  Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] A:","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, the town with more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds would be the one with Bob's bike repair shop.

This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.  Two counties paid a study about acid rain. They  found out Hill county had experienced that, while New county hadn't.  Which county experienced less air pollution? The answer to this question is:","output":"New County experienced less air pollution. Since the study found that Hill County had experienced acid rain while New County had not, it can be concluded that New County had less air pollution that led to the formation of acid rain.

News article: How Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Differ on Taxes Mr. Trump also advocates lowering the tax rate on all business income to 15 percent — and has advocated that the rate apply to all sorts of businesses, including partnerships and sole proprietorships. That opens up room for people to find ways to turn what is now taxed as individual income into “pass-through” business income at that low 15 percent rate, especially those in position to hire tax lawyers to help them figure out the details. For example, an executive who is paid 1 million in salary could instead form a limited liability corporation to “sell” 1 million of management services to his or her old company, cutting the tax rate to 15 percent. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She envisions a 4 percent tax surcharge for income over 5 million, meaning that the very highest earners would effectively have a nearly 44 percent top marginal rate. She also envisions implementing a rule so that those with income over 1 million pay at least 30 percent, aimed at preventing high earners from paying low overall rates thanks to the lower capital gains tax. She would also limit the value of tax deductions, and require longer holding periods to get the low long-term capital gains tax rate, among other steps that would make the tax code less favorable to the affluent. Current: For a married couple making between 18,551 and 75,300, the official marginal tax rate is 15 percent. But in practice, about 45 percent of American taxpayers pay no individual income tax (they do pay federal payroll taxes), because of various tax credits that particularly favor families with children. What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to lower taxes across the board in line with a proposal earlier in the year by House Republicans, which reduced the 15 percent income tax bracket to 12 percent. The Tax Foundation estimated that plan would raise after-tax income for families in the 20th-to-40th percentiles by 0.5 percent, and for middle-income taxpayers by 0.2 percent. Mr. Trump also wants to make child care tax-deductible. If the policy were implemented as a typical deduction, it would provide no advantage for the 45 percent of people paying no tax and provide the biggest advantages to people in high-income tax brackets. His campaign has indicated that the Trump administration would find ways to make its advantages shared more broadly, though staffers had no details. What Mrs. Clinton would do: Americans in the bottom 95 percent of income would see little or no change to their taxes under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. She wants a child care tax credit as part of a broader effort to make child care more affordable, and while she has not enumerated all the details of what she has in mind, a refundable credit would avoid the problems created by offering a tax deduction and would be valuable for lower- and middle-income families even if they don’t pay federal income tax. Current: When a person dies, the first 5.45 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, 10.9 million for a married couple. Assets above those levels are generally taxed at 40 percent before being passed on to heirs. What Mr. Trump would do: He intends to eliminate the estate tax, or the “death tax” as he and other Republicans refer to it, allowing even the wealthiest people to pass along their assets to heirs without being taxed. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She would lower the levels of exemptions to 3.5 million for individuals and 7 million for a couple. More families would have to pay, and very wealthy families would pay taxes on a higher portion of their assets. She would also increase the tax rate on affected estates to 45 percent. Current: It’s complicated. The official corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, higher than for most advanced countries. But the United States also offers a complex range of deductions that mean the effective rate — what is actually collected by the government — is much lower. If that combination of a high rate but low tax collections doesn’t sound very good, congratulations: Tax writers in both political parties agree with you. What Mr. Trump would do: He would sharply cut the top tax rate on corporate profits to 15 percent. And he would apply that rate to partnerships and other types of businesses that currently pass their profits on to individuals who then are taxed at individual income rates as high as 39.6 percent. He would simultaneously eliminate a wide range of business deductions. With the new, lower rate, businesses that earn money overseas and currently keep it outside the United States would have less incentive to do so. So they might repatriate money, pay the lower tax and invest it at home. The proposal would sharply reduce the tax burden on companies, reducing government revenue by 1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation’s estimate. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She seeks a series of tweaks to the corporate tax code to try to dissuade companies from moving operations abroad to save on taxes. One provision would change a key rule to make it harder to execute “tax inversions,” in which a United States firm merges with a foreign competitor and moves its corporate headquarters overseas in order to get access to lower taxes in the merger partner’s country. Another would limit the deductibility of interest when it is used as a tool to avoid American taxes. A third provision is an “exit tax” on companies that relocate outside the United States without first repatriating earnings kept abroad. Mrs. Clinton has also pitched tax credits for companies that hire workers from apprenticeships or share profits with their workers. In her speech Thursday, she said she would reduce red tape facing small businesses as they try to pay their taxes. Current: The United States is on track to have a budget deficit of 534 billion in the current fiscal year and a total of 9.3 trillion over the coming decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would gradually push the total debt relative to the economy to 86 percent from about 75 percent. What Mr. Trump would do: He just overhauled his tax plan on Monday, and there aren’t detailed estimates available yet. But his earlier plan was estimated to reduce federal revenue by 9.5 trillion over the next decade. If not offset by either huge spending cuts or a major burst in economic growth, that would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, even before accounting for potentially higher interest rates as a result. His new proposal would probably reduce tax revenues by less than his original did, though exactly how much has not been fully modeled. What Mrs. Clinton would do: Her tax proposals are estimated to increase federal revenue by 1.1 trillion over the decade. She has said she would use that increased revenue to cover the cost of other policy proposals, with the intention of making her overall agenda have a neutral effect on the budget deficit. An earlier version of this article misstated an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of the budget deficit over the coming decade. It’s 9.3 trillion, not 3.5 trillion. That would make cumulative budget deficits over the decade roughly twice as big as they are currently estimated to be, not 3.7 times larger. An earlier version of this article misstated the exemption threshold for the estate tax for a married couple. The first 10.9 million of the estate is exempt from taxation, not the first 12.9 million.

How to make a spiral cut hot dog  Cook the hot dogs as desired.  Usually boiling or steaming provides the best method to achieve a nice, sleek spiraled effect.  Spear the hot dogs.","output":"Take a wooden skewer and gently run it lengthwise through the center of the hot dog, ensuring it runs end to end for even cutting. Make sure to do this with caution and precision because it's vital for creating the perfect spiral cut hot dog. Now that your hot dog is firmly secured on the skewer, it's time for the creative part. Pick up a sharp knife and position it at an angle on one end of the hot dog. Once it's diagonally positioned, begin to cut into the hot dog as you turn it slowly. This is the start of creating the spiral effect. As you twirl the hot dog, slice it in a spiral way down its length, careful to not cut through to the skewer. The angle of your cuts and the thickness of the spirals are entirely under your control depending on how you want your spiral cut hot dog to look and feel.  Work gradually to ensure the depth of the cuts are even and consistent all along the hot dog. Once the first cut is made, simply rotate the skewer and keep the knife stationary to carve your perfect spirals. The trick here is to keep your knife steady and let the turning of the skewer do all the work.  The aim is to create uniform spirals that go around the hot dog evenly for the best cooking results. If the spirals are too thin or too deep, the hot dog may fall apart during cooking or won't provide the desired visual effect.   Once you have rotated the hot dog all the way down, you'll witness your spiral masterpiece! But, you're not done yet. Gently stretch out the spiraled hot dog. This is to expand the cuts and to allow them to open slightly which will eventually optimize when cooking and give the frank a fun, whimsical aesthetic.  With the hot dog spiral-cut and stretched out, inspect it to ensure there are no uneven pieces and the skewer is still intact. Make sure the spiral grooves are easily distinguishable because the grooves will not only make the hot dog cook evenly but also allow for sauces and toppings to nestle into the grooves for an explosive burst of flavors with each bite.  Completion of this stage shows the successful execution of spiral cutting a hot dog. This process, while simple, requires attention to detail and careful movements. With practice, this technique of spiral cutting will allow you to create perfectly cooked, visually appealing, and flavorsome hot dogs which will be a hit at any barbeque or gathering! Now proceed with cooking as per your desired method and toppings. Enjoy your culinary creation!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Try to set a goal, such as building an emergency fund, saving for a down payment, saving for a major household purchase, or building a retirement fund. If your bank will let you, you can even give your account a nickname such as “Vacation Fund” to help remind you of what you’re working toward. A savings account is generally the easiest place to put your savings if you are just starting out. If you already have a solid emergency fund and have a reasonable amount to invest, such as 1,000, you may consider something like a certificate of deposit (CD). CDs make your money much harder to get to for a fixed period of time but tend to pay you a higher interest rate.   Keeping your savings separate from your checking account will make it less likely that you'll spend your savings. Savings accounts also tend to pay a slightly higher interest rate than checking accounts. Many banks will allow you to set up an automatic transfer between your checking and savings accounts. Set up a monthly transfer from your checking to your savings, even if it’s just for a small amount. That's a relatively painless way to build your savings. If you get a raise, a bonus, a tax refund, or an unexpected windfall, put it in your savings or, if you have one, your retirement account. This is an easy way to help boost your account without compromising your current budget.  If you get a raise, invest the difference between your budgeted salary and your new salary directly into your savings. Since you already have a plan to live off your old salary, you can use the new influx of cash to build your savings. If you work a side gig, build a budget based on your primary source of income, and dedicate your other earnings  to your savings or retirement account. This will help grow your savings faster while making your budget more comfortable. Summary:","output":"To save money effectively, start by setting a clear goal for your savings, such as an emergency fund or a specific purchase. Open a savings account separate from your checking account and consider giving it a nickname to remind you of its purpose. For those with larger amounts to invest, consider a certificate of deposit (CD) for a higher interest rate. Keep your savings separate from your checking account to avoid spending it and take advantage of automatic transfers between accounts to build your savings. Direct any raises, bonuses, tax refunds, or unexpected windfalls to your savings or retirement account to boost your balance without impacting your budget.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Spending a lot of time watching TV, playing video games and surfing the Web causes a lot of healthy problems to children such as overweight and smoking, US researchers said yesterday.  U.S. experts analyzed 173 studies on how media sources influence the physical health of children and adolescents  . The studies, mostly carried out in the prefix = st1 /United States, largely focused on television, but some looked at video games, films, music, computer and Internet use. Three quarters of them found that increased media viewing was connected with poor health. The studies offered strong evidence that children who get more media exposure are more likely to become overweight, start smoking and begin earlier sexual activity than those who spend less time in front of a screen, the researchers said. Studies also showed more media exposure is linked to drug and alcohol use and poorer school performance. \\"We were pretty surprised by the number of studies that showed these negative health results,\\" said one of the researchers in the report. For decades, experts have worried about the effect on young viewers of the violence and sexual content in some TV programs, movies and video games. Another issue is that kids are spending time sitting on a couch  watching TV or playing computer games when they could be running around outside.  One study found that children who spend more than eight hours watching TV per week at age 3 are more likely to be overweight at 7. And research showed that many USchildren watch far more. Another study showed TV and other media content can have a deep influence on children's attitudes and beliefs, particularly among teens. A US study published in November showed that adolescents who watched more programs with sexual themes had a higher risk of becoming pregnant   or causing a pregnancy. Thirteen of 14 studies that evaluated  sexual behavior found a connection between media exposure and earlier sexual behavior, the researchers said. Question: How did the experts carry out their research? Answer: Choose from: (i). By examining health problems including overweight and smoking. (ii). By analyzing 173 studies on influences of media sources. (iii). By watching TV, playing video games and surfing the Web. (iv). By offering strong evidence that children become overweight.

The story, set in New Mexico, begins as Jerry Manning hires a leopard as a publicity stunt for his night-club performing girlfriend, Kiki. Her rival at the club, Clo-Clo, not wanting to be upstaged, startles the animal and it escapes the club into the dark night. The owner of the leopard, a solo sideshow performer named Charlie How-Come—billed as \\"The Leopard Man\\"—begins pestering Manning for money for replacement of the leopard. Soon a girl is found mauled to death, and Manning and Kiki feel remorse for having unleashed the monster. After attending the girl's funeral, Manning joins a posse that seeks to hunt down the giant cat.

News article: Cholesterol screening recommended for 9-year-olds Children should all be tested for high cholesterol between ages 9 and 11 and again between 17 and 21 years of age, regardless of their family history, according to new guidelines released Friday. The updated recommendations, aimed at fighting cardiovascular disease before it starts, came in a report released by the National Institutes of Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics. “The more we learn about heart disease and stroke in adults, the more we know that the process begins in childhood and progresses over time,” wrote Dr. Stephen R. Daniels, chairman of the panel that reviewed the guidelines. “By working with families, we can keep kids at a lower lifetime risk and prevent more serious problems in adulthood.” Previously, the AAP recommended only screening children who had a family history of high cholesterol and heart disease. To make the new recommendations simpler to implement, the panel also suggested that pediatricians could use a specific type of cholesterol screening test that does not require kids to fast before getting their blood drawn. In addition to updating cholesterol screening guidelines, the report also reinforces that children should be exclusively breast-fed through their first year of life, and recommends a diet low in saturated fat after one year. The new guidelines also encourage parents to protect their children from tobacco smoke, and encourages them to engage in physical activity - both contributing factors to heart disease later in life. “We’re aware that pediatricians have a long list of things they have to address as part of health promotion and disease prevention. This is really an important part of what should be on that list,” Daniels wrote. “We as pediatricians really need to get kids started on the right track and keep them in as low a risk category as possible.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article says that doctors recommend testing children for high cholesterol two times: once when they are between 9 and 11 years old, and again when they are between 17 and 21 years old. This is because high cholesterol can lead to heart problems when they grow up, so the doctors want to help children stay healthy. The article also says that babies should be breast-fed for their first year and eat less fatty foods after that. It's important for children to stay away from cigarette smoke and to play and exercise to help their hearts stay strong and healthy as they grow up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the following passage  \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\".

While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions.

Write an article using the following points: Gabriela Osorio, 30, sentenced to 24 years yesterday for attacking 26-year-old new mother in bid to steal her baby. Osorio told her family she had given birth, after faking her pregnancy for nine months, and the baby was in hospital because of a medical problem. She befriended an unidentified 26-year-old mother and tried to suffocate and stab her in an attack to steal her child. Article:","output":"Title: Gabriela Osorio Sentenced to 24 Years for Attempting to Steal Baby from New Mother Introduction: In a shocking turn of events, 30-year-old Gabriela Osorio was sentenced to 24 years in prison yesterday for attempting to steal a baby from a new mother by attacking her. The incident has left a lasting impact on the victim and her family, shedding light on the disturbing lengths people are willing to go for their own selfish reasons. Background of the Case: Gabriela Osorio had been faking her pregnancy for nine long months, deceiving her family and friends into believing that she was expecting a child. In an elaborate ruse, Osorio even informed her loved ones that the baby was in the hospital due to a medical problem, further convincing them of her fabricated pregnancy. The Attack on the New Mother: In her desperate bid to obtain a child and maintain her deceit, Osorio befriended an unidentified 26-year-old new mother. Through this friendship, she meticulously planned and carried out a heinous attack, attempting to suffocate and stab the young mother in order to steal her baby. Step 1: Establishing the connection with the mother: Osorio's first step was to get close to the new mother, gaining her trust and becoming a part of her life. By doing so, she ensured that she had access to the mother and the child, and an opportunity to carry out her plan. Step 2: Identifying the right moment: As the friendship grew, Osorio was eventually given the opportunity to visit the new mother at her home, where she would be isolated and vulnerable. This was the perfect moment for her to execute her heinous plan. Step 3: The attack on the mother: Taking advantage of the situation, Osorio proceeded to try and suffocate the new mother, rendering her unconscious, so she could take the baby without resistance. Failing to achieve this, she brandished a knife and attempted to stab the mother, an act that displayed the lengths she was willing to go to steal a child. The Aftermath and Sentencing: Fortunately, the new mother managed to fight off Osorio's attack, escaping with her baby unharmed. Osorio was apprehended by the authorities and brought to trial for her horrifying actions. The judge ruled that Gabriela Osorio's actions were a dangerous assault on the sanctity of motherhood and posed a significant threat to the safety of the new mother and her baby. In light of this, the judge believed a lengthy sentence of 24 years was an appropriate punishment to reflect the gravity of Osorio's actions and to serve as a deterrent to others considering such heinous acts. Conclusion: Gabriela Osorio's conviction is a harrowing reminder of the dangerous lengths people are willing to go to maintain a lie. This tragic case has sent shockwaves through the community, while also highlighting the importance of vigilance and support for new mothers and their vulnerable infants."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text of article and corresponding title of an article.

Private eye named Jake Masters is hired by eccentric millionaire Jason Dominic to clear up a phony murder rap. The NYPD is hunting for Dominic, in connection with the brutal murder of a cocktail waitress named Lucille Reynolds, and Dominic wants Masters to find the real killer. Masters is sent to La Guardia Airport to pick up Cora MerrillâDominic's trigger-happy troubleshooter. After an initial case of mistaken identity, Jake, his trainee nephew Keith and Miss Merrill head out to Dominic's palatial (but shabby) yacht. Dominic tells them the police believe he killed Lucille because she had filmed an orgy featuring him with three drug-addicted whores, who then blackmailed him out of 50,000. In search of suspects, Jake gets involved with a group of hookers including a bizarre act of necrophilia. Jake eventually stumbles onto the revelation that Cora Merrill has been leading him on â actually working for Jason Dominic to knock off the blackmailers after Jake has located them for her!

The nurse tried to store the medicines inside the cabinets but the","output":"shelves were already cluttered with boxes, bottles, and fading labels. Frustration etched onto her face as she attempted to rearrange the items to make room for the new batch of medications. The tiny storage room had served the small town clinic for decades, but it had seen better days. The paint was peeling off the walls, and dust coated the window sills, adding to the general sense of disarray. The clinic was understaffed, and the nurses often had to multitask, covering the roles of both medical personnel and cleaners. As she struggled to find space, Sarah, the nurse, noticed an odd-looking package wrapped in aged, crinkled dark brown paper. It was tucked away in the back corner of the deepest shelf, covered in a thick layer of dust. Curiosity piqued, she carefully extricated the package from its hiding place. As she held it in her hands, she could feel how heavy and dense the object was, indicating that it was something significant. Carefully unwrapping the paper, she revealed an old wooden box, adorned with elaborate carvings and inlaid with shimmering stones. The carvings depicted various symbols and animals, as well as what seemed to be celestial bodies like stars and comets. The box appeared to be very old, but it was well preserved, devoid of any scratches or damage. Sarah's attention was drawn to the silver clasp that secured the box shut. Meticulously crafted into the clasp was an emblem depicting intertwined snakes, a symbol often associated with healing and medicine. Despite the strange and archaic nature of the box, her curiosity grew stronger, and she decided to open it. The clasp was stiff, resisting her initial attempts to pry it open, but eventually, it yielded, and she carefully lifted the lid. Inside the box, she found a collection of vials, each holding a different color liquid. They seemed to be medicinal potions, long forgotten and left behind by someone from another time. The colors of the liquids were unlike any medicine she had seen before, with vibrant shades of luminescent blue, fiery red, and glowing green. Accompanying the vials was a small, yellowed parchment, covered in neatly written script. Determined to understand the purpose of these mysterious potions, Sarah carefully retrieved the parchment, unfolding it to reveal a list of names, each followed by a unique set of instructions. Much to her surprise, some of the names were familiar to her - they were prominent figures from the town's rich history, dating back centuries. As she read through the instructions, it quickly became apparent that these potions were powerful remedies for ailments that modern medicine had failed to address. What's more, the list included ailments afflicting several of the town's current residents, who were otherwise facing bleak prognoses. A wave of excitement and a sense of newfound responsibility washed over Sarah as she realized that she had made an incredible discovery. With these ancient remedies at her disposal, she could help alleviate the suffering of her fellow townspeople and improve their quality of life. Word spread quickly about the miraculous healing that took place at the clinic. People from neighboring towns and cities began to flock to the small facility, and the once-neglected clinic soon found itself inundated with patients, all seeking relief from their previously untreatable conditions. The overwhelming response prompted the clinic to expand, employing more medical staff and opening its doors to new practitioners who were intrigued by Sarah's fascinating discoveries. Years went by, and the clinic evolved, growing into a renowned regional medical center, its reputation echoing across the land. The town, once struggling to survive, now thrived thanks to the influx of visitors and the prosperity the medical center brought to the area. At the heart of it all was Sarah, who continued to dedicate herself to the well-being of others and forever remained steadfastly focused on learning and harnessing the potential of the mysterious ancient potions. And so, a new chapter in the history of the town began as it emerged from obscurity and embraced its newfound destiny as a beacon of hope and healing, thanks to the selfless dedication of a nurse who had followed her heart and instincts, uncovering a secret that would change countless lives for the better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"Halt the pumping process and incubate the microorganism culture (MOC) statically for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 37 °C and an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To provide a detailed and long explanation of the given statement, let's break down each component and understand the significance of this procedure in the context of microbial culture. 1. Stopping the Pumping: When working with liquid microbial cultures, aeration and agitation are crucial factors influencing the conditions for growth. This is usually achieved by continuous pumping or mixing to ensure the uniform distribution of nutrients, oxygen, and other vital components within the culture medium. In certain cases, it might be necessary to stop this process temporarily or switch to a static incubation. This could be done to allow the cells to adapt to any changes in conditions or to evaluate the effects of this change on the growth and metabolism of the microorganisms. 2. Incubating the MOC statically: Static incubation refers to a time period in which the culture is allowed to rest without any external agitation or mixing. The microorganisms are then expected to adapt and rely on simple diffusion, as no forced circulation of liquid or air is facilitated in the culture medium. This might be done to see how the cells respond to an environment without rigorous mixing or to promote particular growth patterns or metabolic activities in some microorganisms that might prefer static conditions. 3. Duration of incubation: The specified incubation period of 3.5 hours allows sufficient time for the microorganisms to adjust and respond to the altered growth conditions. Depending on the organism and its growth rate, this time frame might be adjusted according to the specific objectives of the experiment. 4. Temperature of incubation: The temperature of 37 °C is a common incubation temperature for many microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus that grow optimally at human body temperature (37 °C or 98.6 °F). Maintaining this specific temperature ensures that the microorganisms experience optimal growth conditions during the incubation period. 5. Atmosphere containing 5% CO2: CO2 is an essential component for microbial growth, as it provides carbon for the synthesis of cellular compounds and can also maintain the pH of the culture medium. The desired atmosphere containing 5% CO2 can be achieved by incubating the culture in a CO2 incubator, where the CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature are carefully maintained and controlled. This environment mimics the natural conditions inside certain host organisms, thereby promoting the growth and activity of some microorganisms. In summary, to follow the instruction provided, you need to stop the pumping process and incubate the MOC statically for 3.5 hours at a temperature of 37 °C and a CO2 concentration of 5%. This procedure is performed to study the response of the microorganisms under these specific conditions, potentially promoting different growth patterns, metabolic activities, or adaptation mechanisms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, if the word \\"piece\\" was intended, it seems out of context and does not have a clear meaning in this sentence. In summary, the word \\"piece\\" has different meanings in the two sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to a work of art or creative composition, while in the second sentence, it appears to be a nonstandard usage that, when replaced with \\"while,\\" conveys the meaning of taking a break for some time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pet the bearded dragon gently.\\"","output":"Title: How to Safely and Gently Pet a Bearded Dragon Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to learn about how to carefully and kindly pet a bearded dragon. Bearded dragons are cool, friendly lizards that many people have as pets. They are named bearded dragons because they have a beard-like part under their chin that can puff up and look like a beard.  But before we learn how to pet a bearded dragon, there is something very important that we need to do first. Can you guess what that is? Yes, that's right! We need to wash our hands. Washing your hands is very important because it helps keep you and the bearded dragon healthy.  Germs and dirt from our hands can make them sick, and we don't want that. So, always remember to wash your hands with soap and water before you touch your bearded dragon friend. Now that our hands are clean, let's learn how to approach the lizard.  Step 1: Approach Slowly Bearded dragons are gentle creatures, but they can get scared if we move too fast or make loud noises. To make sure we don't frighten them, we need to approach them slowly and calmly. Walk up to the lizard very slowly, like a sloth, and do not make any loud noises. This helps the bearded dragon understand that we are not a threat and that we just want to be friends. Step 2: Touch Gently Once we are close enough to touch the bearded dragon without reaching or stretching, it's time to gently touch it. Slowly and softly place your hand on the lizard's back. Remember, always be very gentle – we don't want to scare or hurt our new friend! Step 3: Pet the Bearded Dragon Now that we have softly touched the bearded dragon, it's time to pet it. Using our clean hand, we will gently stroke the lizard's back, moving from its head to its tail. It is important to pet the bearded dragon in the same direction as its scales because that feels nicer for the lizard.  And that's it! Now you know how to safely and gently pet a bearded dragon. Remember to always wash your hands, approach the lizard slowly and calmly, and pet its back gently. This will help you become friends with your bearded dragon and make them feel happy and loved. Happy petting!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

A costumed reveler at a Captain Morgan party celebrates the rum named after the 17th century privateer. We put them in our cocktails, but how well do we know them? Here's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples:. 1. Captain Morgan. The Captain wasn't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer. Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo, Panama. He later looted and burned Panama City, but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671. Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics, Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica. Mental Floss: 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame. 2. Johnnie Walker. Walker, the name behind the world's most popular brand of Scotch whisky, was born in 1805 in Ayrshire, Scotland. When his father died in 1819, Johnnie inherited a trust of a little over 400 pounds, which the trustees invested in a grocery store. Walker became a very successful grocer in the town of Kilmarnock and even sold a whisky, Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky. Johnnie's son Alexander was the one who actually turned the family into famous whisky men, though. Alexander had spent time in Glasgow learning how to blend teas, but he eventually returned to Kilmarnock to take over the grocery from his father. Alexander turned his blending expertise to whisky, and came up with \\"Old Highland Whisky,\\" which later became Johnnie Walker Black Label. 3. Jack Daniel. Jasper Newton \\"Jack\\" Daniel of Tennessee whiskey fame was the descendant of Welsh settlers who came to the United States in the early 19th century. He was born in 1846 or 1850 and was one of 13 children. By 1866 he was distilling whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Unfortunately for the distiller, he had a bit of a temper. One morning in 1911 Daniel showed up for work early and couldn't get his safe open. He flew off the handle and kicked the offending strongbox. The kick was so ferocious that Daniel injured his toe, which then became infected. The infection soon became the blood poisoning that killed the whiskey mogul. Curious about why your bottle of J.D. also has Lem Motlow listed as the distillery's proprietor? Daniel's own busy life of distilling and safe-kicking kept him from ever finding a wife and siring an heir, so in 1907 he gave the distillery to his beloved nephew Lem Motlow, who had come to work for him as a bookkeeper. Mental Floss: The many myths of Jack Daniel. 4. Jose Cuervo. In 1758, Jose Antonio de Cuervo received a land grant from the King of Spain to start an agave farm in the Jalisco region of Mexico. Jose used his agave plants to make mescal, a popular Mexican liquor. In 1795, King Carlos IV gave the land grant to Cuervo's descendant Jose Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo. Carlos IV also granted the Cuervo family the first license to commercially make tequila, so they built a larger factory on the existing land. The family started packaging their wares in individual bottles in 1880, and in 1900 the booze started going by the brand name Jose Cuervo. The brand is still under the leadership of the original Jose Cuervo's family; current boss Juan-Domingo Beckmann is the sixth generation of Cuervo ancestors to run the company. 5. Jim Beam. Jim Beam, the namesake of the world's best-selling bourbon whiskey, didn't actually start the distillery that now bears his name. His great-grandfather Jacob Beam opened the distillery in 1788 and started selling his first barrels of whiskey in 1795. In those days, the whiskey went by the less-catchy moniker of \\"Old Tub.\\" Jacob Beam handed down the distillery to his son David Beam, who in turn passed it along to his son David M. Beam, who eventually handed the operation off to his son, Colonel James Beauregard Beam, in 1894. Although he was only 30 years old when he took over the family business, Jim Beam ran the distillery until Prohibition shut him down. Following repeal in 1933, Jim quickly built a distillery and began resurrecting the Old Tub brand, but he also added something new to the company's portfolio: a bourbon simply called Jim Beam. Mental Floss: A bourbon FAQ. 6. Tanqueray. When he was a young boy, Charles Tanqueray's path through life seemed pretty clear. He was the product of three straight generations of Bedfordshire clergymen, so it must have seemed natural to assume that he would take up the cloth himself. Wrong. Instead, he started distilling gin in 1830 in a little plant in London's Bloomsbury district. By 1847, he was shipping his gin to colonies around the British Empire, where many plantation owners and troops had developed a taste for Tanqueray and tonic. 7. Campari. Gaspare Campari found his calling quickly. By the time he was 14, he had risen to become a master drink mixer in Turin, Italy, and in this capacity he started dabbling with a recipe for an aperitif. When he eventually settled on the perfect mixture, his concoction had over 60 ingredients. In 1860, he founded Gruppo Campari to make his trademark bitters in Milan. Like Colonel Sanders' spice blend, the recipe for Campari is a closely guarded secret supposedly known by only the acting Gruppo Campari chairman, who works with a tiny group of employees to make the concentrate with which alcohol and water are infused to get Campari. The drink is still made from Gaspare Campari's recipe, though, which includes quinine, orange peel, rhubarb, and countless other flavorings. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com.

For the reasons discussed below, the Court does not agree.

After politely complaining, mother, 42, was hit by series of 'childish' pranks. Row came to head when Gary Jones dumped half-eaten cake in her bin. After she tossed it on his doorstep he burst into her home and attacked her. Father is banned from contacting Ms Dowling and her family for three years.","output":"Title: \\"Neighbourly Dispute Escalates Into Bin Battle in South Wales\\" Introduction A seemingly innocent neighbourly disagreement over waste disposal in a South Wales community escalated into a full-blown feud between Joanne Dowling, a 42-year-old mother, and her 58-year-old neighbour, Gary Jones. The initial complaint spiralled into an exchange of childish pranks, culminating in a physical attack that resulted in a restraining order. The Onset of the Bin Battle: A Polite Complaint Joanne Dowling, a conscientious resident of South Wales, approached her neighbour Gary Jones after noticing that he consistently neglected to properly dispose of his rubbish. The 42-year-old mother politely addressed the issue, hoping that a respectful conversation would put an end to the problem. Unfortunately, her attempt at a reasonable resolution was met with hostility, as Jones reacted defensively to Dowling's complaint. A Childish Escalation: Tit-for-Tat Pranks Rather than taking Dowling's concerns on board and amending his waste disposal habits, Jones chose to retaliate by engaging in a series of childish pranks aimed at tormenting Dowling and her family. These immature tactics, driven by a desire for retaliation instead of fostering neighbourly harmony, only served to further inflame tensions between the once-cordial community members. Tensions Boil Over: A Half-Eaten Cake Dispute The bin battle between Dowling and Jones reached a boiling point when Jones disposed of a half-eaten cake in Dowling's bin. Rather than ignoring the clearly provocative move, Dowling responded by tossing the cake back on Jones' doorstep. This action prompted an enraged Jones to barge into Dowling's home, culminating in a physical altercation between the two previously civil neighbours. Restraining Order: A Judicial Intervention In light of the increasingly violent nature of the feud between Dowling and Jones, the court saw it fit to impose a three-year restraining order preventing Jones from contacting Dowling and her family in any manner. This legally enforced separation was deemed necessary in order to protect the well-being of Dowling and her loved ones, while simultaneously providing an opportunity for the community to heal. Conclusion: A Lesson in Neighbourly Relations The bin battle that unfolded between Joanne Dowling and Gary Jones in South Wales serves as a cautionary tale of how seemingly innocuous disputes can quickly escalate into dangerous situations when not handled with maturity and restraint. As neighbours, it is crucial to engage in open dialogue and seek peaceful resolutions to conflicts, fostering a harmonious living environment for all members of the community. In this particular case, had both parties treated the dispute with a level-headed approach, the outcome may have been far less severe, with the issue resolved amicably. Instead, the childish escalation led to lasting unrest, and ultimately, judicial intervention. Communities must learn from such incidents and work together to create a supportive, respectful environment in which conflicts can be addressed and resolved without resorting to malicious tactics, aggression, or violence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Many people have talked about whether or not computing machines can think. Can they or can't they? Almost certainly, a machine can do any work in thinking that a person can do--if the correct way for doing the thinking work can be told exactly. Besides, many programs have been made to direct machines so that they work in very clever ways. Machines have been taught to play chess and to learn from what happens in the games so as to make their play better and better. Machines can beat many persons who play chess. Machines can translate from one language to another. They can prove statements in geometry  as taught in school. Machines can notice printed marks on paper, so that a person is no longer needed to look at the marks. Computers can be used in many ways, such as business, science, industry, and government. _  If people cannot tell exactly the correct way to do certain work in thinking, it is still a question how much of _ a machine can do. Suppose a person is \\"teaching\\" the machine and telling the machine \\"yes\\" when the machine is right, and \\"no\\" when the machine is wrong. Then the machine can keep on searching among possible ways for solving a problem--until the machine can do as well as the person, and perhaps much better. But, what is thinking? People can agree about much that is thinking, and much that is not thinking; but they can't reach agreement because the word \\"think\\" is not a scientific word with an exact meaning. A lot of the discussion is wasted breath because the persons are using different meanings of the word \\"think\\". People, however, have only had experience with machines that appear to think since 1944. It would be too early to say that after the next 200 years, machines will not be thinking. And to consider that machines can think gives people a big push to give to machines more and more work in thinking. Question: Which probably is the best title for the passage? Options: A: What Is Thinking? B: Can Machines Think? C: Can Machines Be Taught to Think? D: Can Machines Beat All Checkers Players? Answer:","output":"B: Can Machines Think?  Reasoning: The passage discusses the capabilities of computing machines in performing various tasks, the comparison between human thinking and machine performance, and the ongoing debate on whether machines can think. The title \\"Can Machines Think?\\" best captures the essence of the passage. While other titles like \\"What Is Thinking?\\" and \\"Can Machines Be Taught to Think?\\" are related to the content, they don't encompass the main focus as well as the chosen title does.

The music video for \\"Closer\\" was directed by Mark Romanek and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network heavily censored the original version, which they perceived to be too graphic. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig's head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S&M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag.  A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.Critical response to The Downward Spiral has generally been favorable, and retrospective reviews regard it as one of the most important albums of the 1990s. It was included in several publications' best album lists: in 2005 the album was ranked 25th in Spin's list of the \\"100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005\\", and in 2003 Rolling Stone ranked the album number 200 on their \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" list.

As the valet workers will be driving your car, it is respectful to tidy up and ensure that their experience driving your car is not a negative one. Remove any trash or leftover items of food at a gas station or service station before starting your trip.  Although washing the exterior of your car is not necessary, do so if your car is extremely dirty. Valet parking is a classy service, so ensuring that your car is presentable will be a nice touch before entering the drop off zone. It is a nice touch to hang an air freshener in your car if you smoke or if you’ve eaten any food in the car recently. Tipping your valet is an important thing to do, as valet jobs are difficult and drivers are sometimes reliant on tips to complete their full minimum wage. Plan on spending 2 - 5 (USD) on tips when you drop off your car, and 2 to 5 dollars when you pick your car back up.  Taking out ten dollars in cash and saving it specifically for tipping will keep you from not having any cash on hand when the time comes. Although a two to five-dollar tip is average, you can tip more if your valet was particularly professional and hard working. Before arriving at your destination, place your valuables in a bag, or take them out of your car before you leave for your destination. Although you should not assume that the valet will steal anything from you, there is no reason to risk theft by leaving something expensive in your car.  Things like electronics, wallets, or sentimental items should all be removed prior to dropping your car off. If you have items that you are not particularly worried about, you can tuck them under the seats of your car. The prices for valet services could vary significantly depending on where you are dropping off your car. Some businesses will provide complimentary valet parking, but others will charge you. Checking beforehand will allow you to prepare for the expense.  Ask if they take credit or debit cards, or if they only accept cash. If you are using valet services at a hotel, they will mostly like charge you a daily rate. When dropping your car off at the valet, there is a chance that your key could be lost. Although this is rare, it is not worth risking your entire key ring. Either bring a spare car key to give the valet worker, or take the key off the ring and bring the rest of your keys with you, keeping them safe and secure. Giving your entire key ring to the valet worker is also a pain for them, especially if you have an abundance of keys on your ring.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of courtesy and etiquette when using a valet service for your car. It highlights several steps to ensure a positive experience for both the car owner and the valet worker, such as tidying up the car's interior, removing trash and leftovers, and cleaning the car's exterior if it is extremely dirty. Additional suggestions include using an air freshener for unwanted smells and tipping the valet worker generously (2-5 USD for both drop-off and pick-up). To avoid any issues with lost keys or theft, car owners should also remove any valuables from their vehicle and separate their car key from other keys on the keyring. It is also advised to inquire about the costs of valet services beforehand, as they can vary significantly depending on the location and type of establishment. Some places may offer complimentary valet parking, while others may charge a fee. It is crucial to check if the valet service accepts credit or debit cards, or if it requires cash payment. In the case of hotel valet services, a daily rate is the most likely pricing structure. Finally, the article advises being prepared for the unlikely event of your car key being lost by the valet service. To minimize potential issues, bring a spare key or detach the car key from the main keyring, enabling you to keep hold of your other important keys and making the valet worker's job easier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"A: The electrons in the small sign are less energized than the electrons in the large sign because the small sign is not lighting up. When a neon sign is functioning properly, electrons within the gas-filled tubes become energized when the applied voltage is sufficient to excite them. These electrons then collide with the gas, typically a mixture of neon and other gases, causing the gas atoms to emit photons, which create the visible light we see in a functioning neon sign. In this case, since the small sign is not lighting up even though it is plugged in, it is possible that the amount of voltage or current being supplied to the small sign is insufficient to energize the electrons, or the sign could be defective. The large sign, on the other hand, is working as expected and is lighting up, indicating its electrons are being energized appropriately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Several years later, a much older Meggie (Eliza Bennett) travels with her father Mo to visit an old book shop in Italy, unaware that he is secretly looking for a copy of the book, Inkheart. Shortly after finding one, Meggie comes across a marten with horns outside the shop, who tries to bite her fingers. Suddenly, a man (Paul Bettany) appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend while revealing the marten's name as Gwin. When Mo comes out of the book shop, he quickly recognizes the man as a person called Dustfinger, whom quickly asks to be read back into the book, only for Mo to flee with Meggie from him. Travelling across Italy, Mo takes Meggie on a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren), whereupon he reveals to Meggie why he fled from Dustfinger.

The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel  had almost no traces of AM fungi.  and a hint : Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations.  Please answer this question : Which parcel had a higher soil nutrient content? A:","output":"The Southern parcel had a higher soil nutrient content.  In the given hint, it is mentioned that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. This is because, under these conditions, plants have less need to invest carbon in their symbiotic relationship with AM fungi as they can access nutrients more easily. As a result, the plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and the fungi, in turn, reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Over time, these environmental conditions can create local adaptations among plant hosts, AM fungi, and local soil nutrient concentrations. Considering this information, we can infer that the Southern parcel, which has almost no traces of AM fungi, experienced higher nutrient and moisture concentrations. This resulted in a decreased reliance on AM fungi by the plants in the Southern parcel, leading to a less diverse and less prevalent AM fungal community. In contrast, the Northern parcel had a higher presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, indicating that the soil nutrient concentrations were likely lower, and the plants relied more heavily on their association with AM fungi to obtain nutrients."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tango Answer:","output":"Title: The Dance of Deceit Genre: Crime Thriller / Action Plot: In the bustling city of Rio de Janeiro, a high-stakes game of corruption and betrayal is set against the vibrant backdrop of the local tango scene. Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Roberts, a retired police detective, now works as a private investigator trying to escape his tumultuous past. Living in the heart of Rio's tango district, he is often seen at the local dance club, El Fuego, where he enjoys a quiet Tango dance. Our story begins as Tommy receives an intriguing case from his past acquaintance, Maria Sanchez. Maria, a captivating and skilled Tango dancer, contacts Tommy to reveal her suspicion that her estranged brother, Gabriel, has gotten involved with a dangerous criminal organization. Maria fears for Gabriel's life and pleads with Tommy to help her gather information about this organization. Against better judgment, Tommy takes the case, only to discover that the syndicate is far more powerful and vicious than he initially thought. Leading the criminal organization is a ruthless and enigmatic individual, Tango, whose identity remains a mystery to both Maria and Tommy. As the confident and inquisitive Tommy Roberts delves deeper into the case, he faces increasingly perilous encounters that put his life in danger. Simultaneously, the chemistry between Tommy and Maria begins to evolve into a passionate romance fueled by the intensity and seduction of Tango. On one fateful night, following a series of intricate dance events that mirror the twists and turns of their investigation, Tommy is cornered in a dimly lit back alley by Tango's henchmen. Just as hope seems to vanish, a shadowy figure appears and offers Tommy a bribe to drop the case and forget what he has learned about the criminal organization. Shockingly, Tommy recognizes the voice as Tango's. Bribery and corruption are cardinal sins in Tommy's book, and he infuriates Tango by refusing the offer and boldly confronting him. As they exchange fiery threats, the tension in the air is palpable. Suddenly, Tango reveals his true identity - Gabriel, Maria's brother. Feeling betrayed and bewildered, Tommy confronts Maria about the truth. Maria, torn between love for Tommy and her loyalty to her brother, confesses that she had been acting under Gabriel's orders to cover their illicit activities. But now, she is falling for Tommy, and her heart is overcome by guilt and confusion. Meanwhile, Tommy struggles as he is forced to decide between the woman he loves and the principles he swore to adhere to as a law enforcer. As the story reaches its climax, Tommy communicates crucial information to the local police about Gabriel's organization without Maria's knowledge. A highly-charged dance competition takes place at El Fuego, where Maria and Tommy, alongside Gabriel and his associates, participate. The tension between them builds to a fever pitch as they dance – secrets and deception playing out in every step, each partner locked in a clash of intense determination. As the dance comes to an end, the entire club is raided by the police, led by Tommy's former partner and friend, Sergio. The shock of the police raid on Gabriel's organization stuns Maria, while Tommy watches on, his face etched with a mix of relief and sadness. In the aftermath, Gabriel is apprehended and the criminal organization dismantled, but Tommy and Maria's relationship is beyond repair. Knowing the consequences of his duty, and believing he did what was right, Tommy watches as Maria tearfully turns away, both of them knowing that the dance of deceit has changed their lives forever. The Dance of Deceit is a tale of passion, betrayal, and moral dilemmas, where the seductive world of Tango encapsulates an intricate web of lies, loyalties, and ultimately, the price one must pay for truth and justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But now as a performance coach, he has found himself in demand once again at SW19 - as a 'hitter'. He has been helping the likes of world No 4 Novak Djokovic and women's quarter-finalist Garbine Muguruza in their pre-match preparations. A coach at the prestigious Millfield School in Somerset, the 27-year-old from Flintshire has taken annual leave to volunteer at the tennis tournament as a hitter for the second year in a row. He has to take what the world's best players can throw at him as they hone their killer shots. \\"A few of the players, they prefer to have a hitter than someone else doing a match warm-up, if that makes sense,\\" he explained from the home of lawn tennis. \\"They can be a little bit more specific with what they do, and almost use me in terms of put me in one corner, or work on something a little more specifically.\\" As a hitter, you are not expected to return every serve - in fact - for some, that just will not happen. \\"Watching (Rafael) Nadal with a hitter is quite funny, because the hitter probably hits one shot, and then Nadal hits a winner past them - but that's how he'll warm up. \\"What you notice is that everyone is completely different. Sometimes it is superstition to have the same hit, the same hitter, even the same court now.\\" In the first week of Wimbledon, James was out on the courts with both Djokovic and Murguruza - who cost Angelique Kerber her top world ranking spot with a win on Monday. \\"I remember getting a phone call... you've got an hour-and-a-half with Novak. I was pretty scared at the start. An hour-and-a-half alone is quite tough in this weather, and then you've got Novak and [coach Andre] Agassi watching you. \\"Quite a surreal moment - but probably one of my most enjoyable ones, out of all of them.\\" And when a hitter hits it off with his player? There are perks. Take Muguruza for example. \\"I don't know if it was superstition or that - but she is the one I've hit with from day one and kept going. \\"It's got to the point now that I'm into the player's box with her, and getting to watch her play, and that's almost a big bonus of what I do. I can practise with someone and actually get a little bit involved with the team.\\" As a junior player, the former Ysgol Maes Garmon pupil from Mold worked his way into the ranks of the world top 100 young players and turned professional. He did make it to a couple of junior matches at SW19 when he was 16 and 17 - but injury meant never as a senior. So now it is the coaching that spurs him on - and why he enjoys being a hitter almost as much as being a player. \\"It's perfect, because I can ask more questions and see what they do, off court a little bit as well,\\" he added. \\"So being able to come here in some capacity is the next best thing, and it's been a really good week.\\" Summary:","output":"A former professional tennis player who had to quit the sport due to hip operations has found a new role as a performance coach and a 'hitter' at Wimbledon. The 27-year-old from Flintshire helps players like Novak Djokovic and Garbine Muguruza with their pre-match preparations by taking their serves and assisting with targeted practice drills. The hitter role provides insights and exposure to top players' techniques and coaching methods, offering valuable experience that can translate into better coaching.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.  I am facing a new situation today: Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article, circadian rhythms are influenced by the amount of light entering the eyes, which helps control the biological clock. This biological clock is responsible for sending signals to the body, causing regular changes in behavior and body processes, including sleep and eating patterns. In the new situation, Jason is an average guy who experiences a natural day-night cycle, which provides consistent exposure to light and darkness. This allows his biological clock to function properly, guiding eating, sleeping, and other behaviors on a regular 24-hour cycle. On the other hand, Brad has chosen to live in a dark cave with minimal exposure to natural light. This environment disrupts his exposure to the day-night cycle, which could significantly impact the regulation of his biological clock. Without a stable light-dark cycle, Brad's circadian rhythms are more likely to be disrupted, potentially leading to irregular patterns of eating, sleeping, and other activities. Therefore, Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day, as his biological clock is functioning optimally due to his regular exposure to a natural light-dark cycle. In contrast, Brad's irregular exposure to light in his cave can lead to a disrupted biological clock, making it less likely for him to have consistent meal times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: (A). yes. (B). no.","output":"(B). No. While the statement provided offers some contextual information about Liberia's account deficit, it lacks a clear and direct answer to the question. An improved and detailed response is as follows: Liberia has been facing economic challenges due to various factors, including a history of political instability, civil wars, and a reliance on foreign aid. Following the end of the civil war in 2003, the country experienced an influx of foreign aid and investment, which played a significant role in rebuilding its economy. However, as a result, Liberia has consistently maintained a large current account deficit, with the percentage peaking in 2008. The current account deficit of Liberia reached its peak in 2008 at approximately 60% of the country's GDP. This figure was primarily driven by a surge in imports – largely consisting of machinery, transportation equipment, and fuel – necessary for post-war reconstruction, and the impact of global food and energy price increases that year. On the other hand, exports in sectors such as rubber, iron ore, and various agricultural products could not keep up with the growth in imports, creating a significant imbalance. The 60% account deficit in 2008 can be attributed to an over-dependence on foreign aid and investment, which created a temporary boost in the economy without fostering self-sustaining growth. Furthermore, the heavy reliance on aid led to inefficiencies, misallocation of resources, and corruption in Liberia's economic system, leaving the country vulnerable to fluctuations in international markets and assistance. To attain sustainable economic growth and reduce the current account deficit, Liberia needs to focus on diversifying its economy, strengthening domestic industries and exports, improving governance and transparency, and developing infrastructure. While foreign aid is essential for the country's recovery, it must be utilized wisely and strategically, with a long-term vision of ensuring economic resilience and self-reliance for Liberia in the future. In conclusion, Liberia's account deficit peaked at nearly 60% in 2008, significantly influenced by an influx of foreign aid and investment following the end of the war. The country must take essential steps toward economic diversification, governance improvement, and further development to achieve long-term economic stability and reduce its reliance on external assistance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Czech","output":"Nyní se mu však poprvé podařilo zeptat se Dom, starověký z Gaie. Ačkoli původní otázka nebyla uvedena, mohu pokračovat v popisu scénáře a povahy Dom a Gaia v českém jazyce pro lepší pochopení kontextu. Dom je prastarý obyvatel planety Gaia, která je součástí Isaac Asimovovy série románů o Nadací. Gaia se odlišuje od jiných planet tím, že je celá spojena do jednoho živého organismu skládajícího se z lidí, zvířat, rostlin a i nerostů. Tato planeta je telepaticky propojená a její obyvatelé sdílejí své myšlenky a zkušenosti s ostatními členy Gaii, což vytváří jakýsi kolektivní vědomí a harmonii v celé společnosti. Dom představuje starověký aspekt gaitské společnosti, jelikož je jednou z nejstarších bytostí na planetě. Svou moudrostí a zkušenostmi získanými během mnoha staletí je pro ostatní obyvatele Gaie zdrojem poznání a inspirace. Ve zmíněné scéně se hlavní postava románové série, Golan Trevize, obrací na Doma s klíčovou otázkou týkající se funkce a účelu Gaie. Jelikož již byl pokus o položení otázky několikrát učiněn, tento okamžik představuje důležitý bod v ději románu. Diskuze s Domem odhaluje hluboké principy a motivace stojící za existencí Gaie. Dom vysvětluje, že Gaia slouží jako záchranný prostředek pro galaxii; jejím hlavním cílem je přinést mír a stabilitu na věčně bojující a konkurenční planety, které tvoří galaktickou civilizaci. Ve snaze dosáhnout tohoto cíle pracují gaiané na rozšíření svého telepatického a harmonického způsobu života na další světy, aby vytvořili rovnováhu mezi individualismem a kooperací, která by mohla vést k trvalé prosperitě pro všechny národy galaxie. Celkově tedy scéna, ve které se hlavní postava zeptá Doma, představuje zásadní moment v příběhu Nadace, kdy se odhaluje pravý účel Gaie a jejího zájmu o budoucnost galaxie. Tento dialog mezi Golanem Trevizem a Domem umožňuje čtenáři porozumět nejen konkrétním hodnotám a cílům Gaiy, ale také vyvolává otázky týkající se rovnováhy mezi individualismem a kolektivismem, které mají dalekosáhlé důsledky pro budoucnost lidstva jako celku."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. China's Recent Trade Statistics Have Been Artificially Inflated Until now, Beijing’s monthly import and export numbers have been considered absolutely reliable, yet there is growing evidence to suggest that in recent months they have been distorted by fabricated transactions. Especially suspect are the export figures for this September and October. China’s exports for September soared 9.9% year-on-year. In the following month, they jumped 11.6%. For many observers, the September number signaled the beginning of the long-awaited recovery of the Chinese economy. The September-October period is now beginning to look like an anomaly from the baseline, represented by the more-typical August and November figures. In fact, the numbers for August and November look remarkably similar. In August, exports increased 2.7%. In November, they were up 2.9%. Imports, always a key sign of growth, fell 2.6% in August. In November, they were unchanged. Are we to believe China had an export boom lasting just two months? Anything is possible, but a more likely explanation for the anomalous September and October figures is that they were distorted by fictitious transactions. Anne Stevenson-Yang of J Capital Research in Beijing, in one of her November e-mail alerts, suggests that the uptick in exports may have been partly due to hot-money inflows caused by currency speculation. Exporters, she notes, are overstating sales, allowing them to book revenues in dollars. They then use the paperwork to get permission to sell dollars for renminbi. The result is that exporters made money with their currency transactions, but the byproduct is that the Ministry of Commerce’s trade figures overstate China’s exports. Tom Holland of the South China Morning Post reports an even more ingenious scheme that has artificially pushed up Beijing’s trade statistics. There is, he notes, legitimate trade where goods go from one part of China to another through Hong Kong. For example, it makes sense to transport through Hong Kong components manufactured in Shanghai for final assembly in Shenzhen. Since 1997, Hong Kong has been part of the People’s Republic, but it is not considered as such for customs purposes. Most of this China-Hong Kong-China trade has been routed through Hong Kong “as a tax dodge.” The benefits are substantial. For instance, China’s rules provide for a value-added-tax rebate of 17% on electronic goods. Moreover, under the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement between China and Hong Kong, no Chinese tariffs are imposed on goods exported to Mainland China if some value was added in Hong Kong. “All that’s needed then is a little imaginative invoicing, and you’ve got one very lucrative tax evasion scam,” Holland writes. “In all probability the goods never actually need to leave the mainland.” Holland believes the value of renminbi transactions associated with this tax stratagem over the past 12 months “may have been well over 1 trillion yuan.” In any event, these fake trades appear to be larger in volume than legitimate speculative trades involving the renminbi, and a well-known European journalist has recently stated that the round-tripped tax dodge trades were “material.” Hong Kong officials, he noted, have passed on information on faked trades to Beijing, which “so far has sat on its hands.” Why would Hong Kong’s officials not crack down on these transactions on their own? One reason is that they appear to be under orders to promote Hong Kong as the place to trade renminbi and these deals inflate statistics on renminbi usage there. Holland notes that all the fake trades are probably conducted in China’s currency to avoid the expense of forex dealings. Furthermore, Beijing gets a twofer: the fake transactions swell China’s import and export numbers and they artificially enlarge the statistics showing trade settlement in renminbi, something Chinese officials want to promote. Tom Holland’s fascinating reporting would not explain the September-October bump in exports, but he does show that these tax-dodge transactions have generally bloated Beijing’s trade numbers. And how long have these transactions padded China’s trade statistics? The fake transactions probably go back to 2010 because importers and exporters began to use the renminbi for trade settlement purposes in 2009.

Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as AIDS. This stage is often also associated with weight loss. HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years. In 2015 about 36.7 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 1.1 million deaths. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39 million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemica disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV is believed to have originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention...  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test....  - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age.  - Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material (a vaccine) to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen. Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, this results in herd immunity. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine, the HPV vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five preventable infections.  - Miliary tuberculosis ( also known as \`\` disseminated tuberculosis '' , \`\` tuberculosis cutis acuta generalisata '' , and \`\` Tuberculosis cutis disseminata '' ) is a form of tuberculosis that is characterized by a wide dissemination into the human body and by the tiny size of the lesions ( 1 -- 5 mm ) . Its name comes from a distinctive pattern seen on a chest radiograph of many tiny spots distributed throughout the lung fields with the appearance similar to millet seeds -- thus the term \`\` miliary '' tuberculosis . Miliary TB may infect any number of organs , including the lungs , liver , and spleen . Miliary tuberculosis is present in about 2 % of all reported cases of tuberculosis and accounts for up to 20 % of all extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases .  - Sputum is mucus and is the name used for the coughed-up material (phlegm) from the lower airways (trachea and bronchi). This process is known as sputilization. In medicine, sputum samples are usually used for naked eye exam, microbiological investigations of respiratory infections and cytological investigations of respiratory systems. It is critical that the patient not give a specimen that includes any mucoid material from the interior of the nose. Naked eye exam of sputum can be done at home by a patient in order to note the various colors (see below). Any hint of yellow color suggests an airway infection (but does not indicate between the types of organisms causing it). Such color hints are best detected when the sputum is viewed on a very white background such as white paper, a white pot, or a white sink surface. The more intense the yellow color, the more likely it is a bacterial infection (bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, or pneumonia).  - A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \\"wild\\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are being investigated).

About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The New York Times Ms. Holmes, as far as I know, is remaining fully dressed in “All My Sons.” It’s Daniel Radcliffe, the young actor who achieved international celebrity as the title character in the Harry Potter movie franchise, who bids fair to pull a Nicole this season. Mr. Radcliffe will be doing the full monty in the revival of Peter Shaffer’s “Equus” (also starring Richard Griffiths and set to open on Sept. 25 at the Broadhurst Theater), a psychological melodrama with a certain literary heft. The timing is most auspicious for Mr. Radcliffe, whose performance in “Equus” in London garnered admiring reviews. The Potter series, after all, is nearing its end. And while Mr. Radcliffe has yet to leave adolescence, he is probably as tired of being The Boy (especially That Boy) as Ms. Holmes is of being The Girl. They grow up so quickly these days. I missed seeing Mr. Radcliffe in London, so I can’t personally vouch for his stage chops, nor for those of Ms. Holmes. But I can predict with confidence that another familiar movie face, Kristin Scott Thomas, will seem right at home in Ian Rickson’s production of Chekhov’s “Seagull,” which I caught (and loved) in London in 2006. Ms. Scott Thomas, who is known to movie audiences for looking enigmatic and patrician in films like “The English Patient,” may be making her Broadway debut this season. But she has already proved her classic stage mettle in London with arresting turns in Chekhov (“The Three Sisters” as well as “The Seagull”) and Pirandello (“As You Desire Me”). She is joined in “The Seagull” (to open on Oct. 1 at the Walter Kerr) by Peter Sarsgaard, who in recent years has been cutting a cinematic swath with movies that include “Boys Don’t Cry” and “Kinsey.” The first time I saw him, though, was way off Broadway 12 years ago, when he was giving a blissfully funny performance as a male variation on Blanche du Bois in the Drama Department’s brilliant deconstruction of Tennessee Williams’s “Kingdom of Earth.” I am not nervous about the first Broadway outings of Ms. Scott Thomas, Mr. Sarsgaard or, for that matter, Jeremy Piven, who will be appearing as a foulmouthed studio executive in a revival of David Mamet’s “Speed-the-Plow” (to open on Oct. 23 at the Ethel Barrymore). Mr. Piven has of course had several years of practice impersonating a dirty-talking Hollywood power player as the slimy über-agent in the HBO series “Entourage.” But he also showed sturdy stage legs when he appeared Off Broadway in 2004 in Neil LaBute’s “Fat Pig.” No, the Hollywood celebrity I’m really worried about is that big green lug named Shrek, the popular animated movie hero who will be trying to effect the transition from two to three dimensions (and from speech to song) when he appears in the eponymously titled musical scheduled to open on Dec. 14 at the Broadway Theater.

The boss of HSBC was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus. Speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about HSBC’s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his ‘shame’ at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some £5million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal. This lasted from 1998 until 2011, when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a ‘classic case of tax avoidance’. The HSBC boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax. He said there was ‘no tax advantage’ and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003. Springing to his defence, the bank’s chairman, Douglas Flint, said: ‘There is absolutely no story here. There is nothing that Stuart has done that is not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate.’ Seeking to justify his tax status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35-year career at HSBC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBC’s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regulators, Stuart Gulliver said: ‘We seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or any large organisation. ‘It seems to be a notion that Douglas [HSBC chairman Douglas Flint] and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long. That isn’t normally how large organisations can run.’ HSBC has been criticised as being ‘too big to manage’ after a series of scandals flared up on Mr Gulliver’s watch. It was fined £1.2billion by US regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined £400million by UK and US authorities last November for rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Mr Gulliver may be right that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought it on themselves.’ ‘I would expect to die abroad,’ he added. But the comments received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was ‘astonished’ that HM Revenue & Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remain domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the past 12 years. ‘Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance,’ he said. ‘But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. ‘There are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax.’ Although there is no suggestion that Mr Gulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped clients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a ‘source of shame and reputational damage to HSBC’. Despite this he received a £7.6million pay package last year, including a £1.3million bonus. This was a drop from his £8million package in 2013 – his bonus was cut by £500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to £12.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from £2.6billion to £2.4billion. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Stuart Gulliver, the boss of HSBC, is facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus. Gulliver was forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some £5million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Gulliver said there was \\"no tax advantage\\" and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003.

Determine the sentiment: After \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" redefined science fiction, and \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" redefined \\"Star Wars\\", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of \\"A New Hope\\" and the more sinnister tone of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for \\"Return of the Jedi\\" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. A THIRD must-see for film fans.","output":"The sentiment of this text is positive. The author praises \\"Return of the Jedi\\" for its action, suspense, and the way it combines elements from the previous two films in the trilogy.

While they mention a few negative aspects, such as the far-fetched idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers and some technical issues, the overall tone is celebratory and complimentary, with the author calling it a \\"must-see\\" for film fans."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Background: Gregory James \\"Greg\\" LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is an American former professional road racing cyclist who won the Road Race World Championship twice (1983 and 1989) and the Tour de France three times (1986, 1989 and 1990). He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. Context: LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him in the center of the anti-doping controversy.  LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari, and has pointed out that doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. Said LeMond: \\"When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.\\"  LeMond's most notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. He has also been critical of Alberto Contador, the UCI, and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\"  McQuaid rejected LeMond's call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond. Ultimately McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy. Lemond had supported Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle. Question: Was there any controversies on Anti-doping?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there have been controversies surrounding anti-doping, with Greg LeMond being at the center of some of these controversies due to his vocal opposition to performance-enhancing drug use in cycling. LeMond's outspokenness on the issue has led him into conflicts with fellow cyclists, including Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis, as well as the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) leadership such as former president Pat McQuaid. Key controversies surrounding anti-doping include: 1. LeMond's public criticism of Lance Armstrong's relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari in 2001, which fueled doubts about the legitimacy of Armstrong's Tour de France victories. This ultimately led to Armstrong being stripped of his titles and banned from professional cycling after being found guilty of systematic doping. 2. LeMond's criticism of Floyd Landis, who was also stripped of his 2006 Tour de France victory due to doping. 3. LeMond's call for a change in UCI leadership to address the issue of doping in cycling, which was met with resistance from Pat McQuaid. LeMond later supported Brian Cookson, who defeated McQuaid in the UCI presidential election in 2013. These controversies highlight the ongoing challenges and debates surrounding anti-doping efforts in professional sports, particularly in cycling. LeMond's dedication to anti-doping advocacy has contributed to raising awareness and fostering change in the fight against performance-enhancing drug use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot.

Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America.  She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider.  Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War.  He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey.  Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers.  The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations.  He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957.

Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah. Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, \\"He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.\\" Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane. During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \\"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\\" From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \\"born again\\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \\"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic.

Use the following highlights to write an article: New iPhone \\"kill switch\\" targets crime known as \\"Apple picking\\" Tool is part of new operating system for the iPhone. It requires a password to deactivate \\"Find My Phone\\" or wipe data. Mobile device theft a growing concern for law enforcement.","output":"Title: The New iPhone \\"Kill Switch\\": A Game Changer for Mobile Device Security Introduction: In recent years, mobile device theft, specifically known as \\"Apple picking,\\" has been a growing concern for law enforcement worldwide. To address this issue, Apple has introduced a new security feature, dubbed the \\"kill switch,\\" which is integrated into the latest iPhone operating system. This technological innovation aims to deter criminals from stealing iPhones by adding a password layer to critical device functions such as deactivating the \\"Find My Phone\\" feature or wiping data from the device. Step 1: Detailing the \\"Apple Picking\\" Phenomenon To better understand the need for the iPhone \\"kill switch,\\" it's important to shed light on the widespread crime of \\"Apple picking.\\" This term refers to the theft and subsequent illegal sale of iPhones that exploits the value and desirability of these devices in the market. A discussion about the extent of the problem and the various ways thieves have managed to bypass security precautions will provide context for the significance of the new \\"kill switch\\" feature. Step 2: Describing the \\"Kill Switch\\" Feature The main component of the article will focus on explaining the new \\"kill switch\\" tool in detail. This includes describing how it works, the added layer of security it provides, and its integration into the updated iPhone operating system. By highlighting the new password requirement to deactivate key features such as \\"Find My Phone\\" or to erase data, the article will illustrate how the \\"kill switch\\" makes it more difficult for criminals to render a stolen iPhone untraceable. Step 3: Law Enforcement and Industry Reactions To demonstrate the significance of the \\"kill switch,\\" it's essential to cover reactions from law enforcement agencies and the mobile device industry. This involves discussing the ways in which the new feature is expected to deter thieves, reduce the illegal resale market for stolen iPhones, and improve overall mobile device security. Furthermore, it would be interesting to explore whether other mobile device manufacturers are planning on adopting similar security measures. Step 4: Highlighting Potential Concerns and Future Improvements Finally, while the introduction of the \\"kill switch\\" is a notable step towards enhancing mobile device security, the article should discuss potential concerns and areas for future development. This may include addressing possible flaws in the new security feature, the extent of its effectiveness against determined criminals, and whether further enhancements could be introduced in future operating system updates. Conclusion: The iPhone \\"kill switch\\" feature is a major milestone in the fight against mobile device theft and \\"Apple picking.\\" By adding increased password protection to crucial features, it becomes significantly more difficult for criminals to profit from stolen iPhones. Though potential concerns and future improvements should not be overlooked, the \\"kill switch\\" sends a strong message that innovative technologies have the power to combat crime and protect consumers' valuable personal devices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a  Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix.

It's innovatively designed in a way that attracts anyone with an affinity for console interfaces. The first thing I noticed is the app's striking minimalistic design. The app successfully recreates the console experience on a smartphone, which is certainly an impressive achievement (Step one: Mention the overall design and aesthetics). The command-line interface is responsive and feels very smooth to operate.  Another quality that stood out is the app's performance; it's notably swift without any lag. The commands are executed instantly and the software shows very little fatigue, even when multiple commands are thrown at it at once (Step two: Discuss about the app's performance). The customization options are quite wide-ranging. From themes to skins, the ability to tweak according to one's preference is a big thumbs up (Step three: Mention about the app's customization and flexibility).  There's also a considerable variety of built-in commands, including some you wouldn't expect, like for calling or texting contacts, opening apps, browsing the web, etc. This opens up fascinating potential for increasing efficiency and optimizing user operations (Step four: Discuss about the features of the app). As for the reasons I withheld that extra star - firstly, this app has a steep learning curve for individuals who are not familiar with this kind of interface. Comprehensive tutorials or guides are needed to help these users gain command over the tool (Step five: Highlight one of the issues or negatives, explaining reason I deducted a star). Secondly, there are times when voice command does not work as expected, especially in noisy environments.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

Given the below context:  (English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought...  Guess a valid title for it!

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society (\\"Why Can't the English?\\"). At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality.  Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally (\\"Just You Wait\\"). She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \\"gets it\\" (\\"The Rain in Spain\\"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent (\\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\").

Write a summary based on this article: Motoring show courts controversy again as co-host tells Jeremy Clarkson he doesn’t eat ice-cream, adding: ‘It’s something to do with being straight’      Richard Hammond under fire for 'ice-cream is gay' line on The Grand Tour      Richard Hammond has been criticised for linking eating ice-cream with being gay on the latest episode of The Grand Tour, the TV motoring show he co-hosts with Jeremy Clarkson and James May.      The exchange occurred on Happy Finnish Christmas, the sixth episode of the first season of the show, which was released on Amazon Prime on 23 December.      In front of a live audience, Clarkson pointed to an image of the interior of a Rolls Royce, saying: “The only problem is that in one of those, you couldn’t enjoy a chocolate Magnum ice-cream.”      “It’s all right, I don’t eat ice-cream,” replied Hammond. “It’s something to do with being straight.”      Ollie Cole (@ProducerOllie) 🤗 hello & here's the full richard hammond 'ice creams are gay' piece and yeah, it's awful pic.twitter.com/JhDisRsc1Q      Clarkson and May appeared taken aback as members of the studio audience applauded and cheered.      “Why are you applauding him?” Clarkson, apparently aghast, asked the crowd. “What do you mean? … You’re saying all children are homosexual?”      The Grand Tour is everything that was wrong with Clarkson-era Top Gear Read more      Hammond continued, saying: “Ice-cream is a bit – you know”. He added: “There’s nothing wrong with it, but a grown man eating an ice-cream – it’s that way, rather than that way …      “I’m right. I can’t believe you can’t see that. It’s easy. It’s in front of you.”      Clarkson and Hammond then joked about “the chocolate thingy” in a 99 ice-cream cone, with the latter declaring: “My case rests!”      A spokesman for LGBT equality charity Stonewall said Hammond’s choice of words was not only ridiculous, but “chosen purposefully to mock and belittle”.      “Stonewall trains teachers to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic slurs like these, so to hear this sort of language on television is extremely disappointing and sends the wrong message to young people.”      Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: “It is a perverse world when an everyday pleasure like ice cream becomes the butt of homophobic innuendo.

The first episode of The Grand Tour broadcast in late November to much interest from fans of Top Gear, following Hammond, May and Clarkson’s departure from the long-running BBC World franchise.      “They open their mouths and suddenly it’s same-old same-old,” wrote Sam Wollaston in his review of the new show for the Guardian. “Nought to racist in less than 10 minutes.”            In the first episode, Clarkson joked that he could not be fired “because we’re on the internet, which means I could pleasure a horse”. On that occasion, Wollaston wrote, it was May and Hammond who looked “faintly embarrassed”. ||||| TV presenter Richard Hammond has been criticised after making a joke about eating ice cream being gay.      He was responding to a comment made by Jeremy Clarkson on The Grand Tour.      Talking to an audience, co-host Clarkson points at a photo of a Volvo's interior and says: \\"The only problem is that in one of those, you couldn't enjoy a chocolate Magnum ice cream.\\"      Richard Hammond replied: \\"It's all right, I don't eat ice cream. It's something to do with being straight.\\"      After the audience on the Amazon Prime show applauded, Jeremy Clarkson asks: \\"Why are you applauding him? What do you mean? You're saying all children are homosexual?\\"      Richard Hammond replies: \\"What? What? Ice cream is a bit - you know... There's nothing wrong with it, but a grown man eating an ice cream - it's that way, rather than that way.      \\"I'm right. I can't believe you can't see that. It's easy. It's in front of you.\\"      But Twitter users aren't happy about the comments.      Years & Years singer Olly Alexander made a joke about it while others people went further.      LGBT campaigner, Peter Tatchell, has also criticised Richard Hammond.      Speaking on BBC 5 Live Daily, he's told Adrian Chiles that he thinks the comments \\"pander to prejudice\\".      \\"It's a perverse world when everyday pleasures like ice cream becomes the butt of homophobic innuendo,\\" he said.      \\"That Richard Hammond thinks he needs to boast about his heterosexuality is weird and it will get people wondering, 'Why? Why is he saying that?'      \\"His pandering to prejudice is bad enough, of course. But the audience applause that he got makes it even worse, and I think it shows that we still have some way to go to end bigoted banter.\\"      There's no word yet from Richard Hammond or the producers of The Grand Tour.      The comments were made on the sixth episode of the Amazon Prime show, which was called Happy Finnish Christmas.      It was released on 23 December.      A spokesman for LGBT equality charity Stonewall said: \\"Hammond's choice of words were not just ridiculous, but chosen purposefully to mock and belittle.      \\"This is the sort of childish language heard in playgrounds across Britain.      \\"Stonewall trains teachers to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic slurs like these, so to hear this sort of language on television is extremely disappointing and sends the wrong message to young people.\\"      In the same episode Richard Hammond also takes a dig at the Top Gear scene filmed at the Cenotaph in central London earlier this year.      Driving a Mustang on a tour of the city, he says: \\"That is the Cenotaph, where we remember those who died fighting for us. Slow down a bit here, show some respect.\\"      The BBC show, formerly fronted by The Grand Tour's Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, was criticised after new host Matt LeBlanc and a professional driver performed \\"doughnuts\\" near the war memorial.      Former co-host Chris Evans apologised for the stunt, and said he and the crew were \\"mortified\\".

Sabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay. Sabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at Vogue and returns as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor. David's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Linus tries to redirect Sabrina's affections to himself and it works. Sabrina falls in love with him, even though she quotes others as calling Linus \\"the world's only living heart donor\\" and someone who \\"thinks that morals are paintings on walls and scruples are money in Russia.\\" In the process, Linus also falls in love with her.  Unwilling to admit his feelings, Linus confesses his scheme to Sabrina at the last minute and sends her back to Paris. Before she gets on the plane to Paris, her father informs her that over the years of chauffeuring the father of David and Linus, he listened. When Mr. Larrabee sold, he sold and when Mr. Larrabee bought, he bought. Sabrina jokingly says \\"So you are telling me that you have a million dollars?\\" Her father says no, he has a little over two million and that her mother would want her to have it.","output":"Thomas Fairchild, the chauffeur of the Larrabee family, got rich by listening to the advice of the Larrabee family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The  Select from: [a]. bat must be sturdily made.. [b]. other equipment must be sturdily made..","output":"The sentence should end with option [b]. \\"The other equipment must be sturdily made.\\" Here is the completed sentence followed by a detailed explanation: \\"At softball practice, Clare ruined the bat, but her other equipment was fine. The other equipment must be sturdily made.\\" This sentence is highlighting the fact that while Clare somehow managed to ruin the bat during her softball practice, her other equipment, such as her gloves, helmet, and cleats, remained in good condition. From this observation, one could infer that Clare's other equipment is of higher quality or more durable compared to the bat that was ruined.  Softball equipment can vary widely in terms of quality and durability. Some bats, such as wooden ones, may break or splinter with heavy or repeated use, while aluminum or composite bats are typically more resistant to damage. Similarly, helmets, gloves, and cleats can also vary in their construction materials and design, potentially affecting their ability to withstand heavy use or impacts during play. With this sentence, the focus is on emphasizing the contrast between the bat and the other equipment by highlighting their different outcomes during practice. It suggests that while the bat wasn't able to withstand the demands of practice, the other equipment remained intact, which implies that the other equipment is sturdier in nature. In essence, the complete sentence paints a picture of a softball practice where the player, Clare, experienced a mishap with her bat while the rest of her gear proved to be more reliable. By choosing the option that reads, \\"The other equipment must be sturdily made,\\" the sentence effectively highlights this contrast, allowing us to understand the situation better and infer the quality of the equipment being used."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service.

Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Fox News Inspiring Climate Science Fox News would seem to be an unlikely source of inspiration for climate scientists, but amid the pundits and the botched infographics, Rupert Murdoch‘s fair and balanced news team struck a nerve on climate change. The news reported was this: Despite all this talk about global warming, the past decade actually saw less warming than the previous 30 years. Explain that, climate changers! While it is true that temperatures plateaued from 1998 to 2008, that fact, taken out of the broader context of climate, leads to all sorts of false assumptions. And so it is that, when confronted by yet another member of the public citing the Fox News stat, climate scientist Robert Kaufmann set about finding a scientific explanation. The thing is, there’s nothing at all straightforward about climate science. Kaufmann’s initial report, published earlier this month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and a paper by another group of researchers trying to explain the cooling, published yesterday in Science, are just the latest examples. As the BBC’s Richard Black points out, “Emitting excess greenhouse gases is only one of the ways in which human industry, agriculture, and transport are affecting the atmosphere.” The latest studies point out that both humans and nature emit sulfate aerosols (tiny particles)–humans by burning fossil fuels, and nature by kicking around dust and volcanic ash (hey, watch it, nature). Although other theories remain about why this past decade was cooler than those previous, scientists seem to be converging around this idea that sulfate particles, which reflect the sun, are the culprits. Kaufmann’s paper pointed at the rapid increase in coal production in China, and the consequent emission of sulfate particles in the low atmosphere, as the cause. So … coal combats global warming? Erm, no. Although sulfate particles may have had the short-term effect of cooling temperatures, in the long run, pumping CO2 into the atmosphere spells trouble. And in fact those same sulfate particles are a primary ingredient in acid rain, so loading the atmosphere with them is probably not a good idea either (although geoengineering proponents have suggested doing exactly that to help cool the climate). Other scientists have noted that while coal production has been increasing in China over the past several years, it has been decreasing elsewhere. According to Hiram Levy, a climate modeler at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, there has been an overall increase of 10 percent in sulfate emissions over the last decade, which wouldn’t be enough to explain the slowdown. Enter this month’s second big climate science paper, which includes new research from NOAA as well as other groups. Their theory builds upon Kaufmann’s, positing that it was sulfate particles released in the stratosphere–not the atmosphere–that caused cooling, and that the sulfates could have come from human activity, natural causes, or a combination of the two. All of which illustrates one of the big problems with climate science: communication. How do you explain to people who don’t study climate that what is often referred to as “global warming” doesn’t mean a steady warming of temperatures over time? That today’s weather may have nothing at all to do with the climate on the whole? That there are multiple natural and human activities happening in tandem and having various, complex effects on the climate? That, as Mike Lemonick of Climate Central eloquently puts it, “Anthropogenic warming has never been predicted to be steady. Understanding episodes of faster and slower warming has always been a goal of climate scientists.” It has taken some of the brightest scientists in the world over a year’s worth of research to look at all the inputs into the climate and come up with some plausible theories to explain what it’s doing. And that was all sparked by a Fox News citation. The trouble is, the 600 or so words above don’t fit neatly into a soundbyte or an infographic, nor do the complexities of climate science, so the chances of mainstream audiences getting a truly fair and balanced view of climate change remain slim.","output":"Fox News mentioned that the past decade had less warming than the previous 30 years. A climate scientist, Robert Kaufmann, wanted to find out why this was true. He discovered that sulfate particles might be the reason. These particles come from humans burning fossil fuels and from nature, like dust and volcanic ash. They reflect sunlight, which can make the Earth cooler. Kaufmann thinks that China's increased coal production might be causing more sulfate particles in the atmosphere. However, even if these particles can cool the Earth temporarily, they are also a main part of acid rain and might be adding to other climate problems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Michigan Alcohol-Screening Test (MAST), developed in 1971, is a tool used to screen for alcohol abuse and dependence; however, it doesn't necessarily mean that the subjects taking the test are intoxicated or too drunk at the time of taking the test. The MAST was designed to help health professionals identify individuals who may have problematic alcohol use and who may require further assessment or intervention. It is a self-report questionnaire with the purpose of gathering information about an individual's alcohol consumption, its consequences, and potential patterns indicative of abuse or dependence. It is not a test specifically aimed at intoxicated individuals, nor does it require intoxication or drunkenness to be completed. The MAST can be administered in a variety of settings, such as hospitals, clinics, educational institutions, or rehabilitation centers. It is triggered by different factors such as individual self-referral, professional referral, or as part of a broad screening battery. The individuals who take the MAST don't necessarily have to be drunk at the moment of taking the test; therefore, the claim that most people are too drunk to finish all 24 questions is not supported by the premise. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that a screening tool such as the MAST is only the first step in determining whether a person has alcohol-related problems. It can provide an indication of problematic alcohol use, but further assessment, such as a comprehensive clinical interview, additional tests, or collateral information, is required to establish a clear diagnosis and determine an appropriate treatment plan. In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis \\"Most people are too drunk to finish all 24 questions.\\" The premise itself does not directly address the intoxication levels of individuals taking the test, nor does the purpose or administration practices of the MAST make such a claim plausible. A screening tool like the MAST is designed to identify potential alcohol abuse or dependence, rather than focusing on the state of intoxication of the test-takers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The veteran promoter has written to Klitschko’s representatives to make a fight in March between the Ukrainian world champion and Fury, the mandatory challenger for his WBO world title. But there has been no reply to the email and Warren confirmed there have been no positive indications that the younger Klitschko will fight Fury.

Frank Warren and Fury were at the Landmark Hotel in London to promote his next fight on February 28. Klitschko is scheduled to fight in March and will then have to fight Fury or vacate the WBO portion of his collection of world titles. Warren said: ‘We wrote to klitschko’s people, “Why don’t we cut to chase and do the fight in March?” They have not even responded to say “s** off” or “not interested”. ‘I’ve heard nothing at all. The fight will be mandated by the WBO after his next fight. They will then have to sit down with us.’ Should Klitschko vacate it will validate a prediction unbeaten Fury made three years ago. Warren said he had written to Wladimir Klitschko's representatives but not heard anything back. He extended his record to 23 wins from 23 fights against Dereck Chisora last month and is due to fight again on February 28 at the O2 Arena – a card that will also feature Chris Eubank Jnr. But his target is Klitschko, though he doesn’t believe the fight will happen. ‘I have said for three years that I don’t think he will ever fight me,’ Fury said. ‘That is my opinion. I can’t see that happening. I would like to fight for the title and take it off him rather than fighting for a vacant title. ‘It is OK (Klitschko) fighting bums, but a guy who can change tempo and style? That is different. I don’t think he is ready for that.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"So, this article is talking about a possible boxing match between two famous boxers, Tyson Fury and Wladimir Klitschko. Frank Warren, who is like a boss for Tyson Fury, is trying to set up a big fight between them. But, Wladimir Klitschko and his team have not responded to Frank Warren's emails about making this happen. Tyson Fury really wants to fight Wladimir Klitschko, but he feels like it might not happen. If they do not fight, Wladimir Klitschko might have to let go of one of his boxing titles. Frank and Tyson are promoting another fight that will happen on February 28th, at O2 Arena, but their main goal is to fight against Wladimir Klitschko."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: i. Rub wax paper all over the headlight until it's see through again. ii. Rub sandpaper all over the headlight until it's see through again.","output":"In terms of naive physics reasoning, the more sound solution to make a headlight less cloudy is option ii. Rub sandpaper all over the headlight until it's see-through again. Here's an analysis of both the solutions: i. Rub wax paper all over the headlight until it's see-through again: Using wax paper on headlights might initially sound like an easy and inexpensive solution, but it does not appropriately address the core issue of cloudy headlights. The cloudiness on headlights is typically formed by the gradual wear and degradation of the outer layer of the headlight, which is made of a plastic material called polycarbonate. This wear and degradation are often caused by exposure to sunlight, debris, and dirt and lead to oxidation which manifests as the cloudy appearance.  Although rubbing wax paper on the surface of the headlight might smoothen it temporarily, it does not effectively remove the degraded outer layer or significantly reduce oxidation. Consequently, this method lacks the capacity to provide a long-lasting solution to restore the headlight's clarity. ii. Rub sandpaper all over the headlight until it's see-through again: Using sandpaper to address cloudy headlights is a more effective solution, as this method removes the oxidized and degraded outer layer of the polycarbonate material, revealing a clearer surface underneath. This method typically involves the following steps: 1. Clean the headlight using soap and water to remove surface dirt and dust. 2. Mask off the surrounding areas of the headlight to protect the vehicle's paint from accidental sanding. 3. Soak sandpaper (preferably with grit ratings of around 800, 1200, and 2000) in water for a few minutes prior to use. The wet-sanding method reduces friction-generated heat and helps to remove debris and excess material more efficiently. 4. Begin with a lower grit sandpaper (800 grit) and rub it over the headlight in a back-and-forth or circular motion while keeping the sandpaper and headlight surface wet. After consistent use of the 800 grit, switch to the 1200 grit and continue the same process, and eventually move up to the 2000 grit sandpaper. 5. Clean the headlight surface with water during each change of grit rating to observe the progress and ensure all cloudiness is removed. 6. After removing the oxidized layer using sandpaper, apply a plastic polish to restore the headlight's shine and clarity further. The polish can be applied using a microfiber cloth or with a polishing pad attached to a drill for best results. 7. As a final step, use a UV-protectant sealant (such as a clear coat) to protect the headlight from further degradation, thereby prolonging its clarity. In conclusion, based on naive physics reasoning, solution ii (using sandpaper) is more effective in removing cloudiness and restoring the transparency of a headlight compared to solution i (using wax paper). The sandpaper method not only removes the degraded, oxidized outer layer but also provides a longer-lasting result coupled with the application of plastic polish and a UV-protectant sealant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Information:  - Zynoviy Bohdan Khmelnytsky (Ruthenian language:   ii; modern ; \\"Bohdan Zynoviy Mykhailovych Khmelnytsky\\" 6 August 1657), was the Hetman of the Zaporozhian Host of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth (now part of Ukraine). He led an uprising against the Commonwealth and its magnates (16481654) which resulted in the creation of a state led by the Cossacks of Ukraine. In 1654, he concluded the Treaty of Pereyaslav with the Tsardom of Russia. The Khmelnytsky Uprising led to the deaths of an estimated 18,000 -100,000 Jews.  - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.  - The Khmelnytsky Uprising (; also known as the Cossack-Polish War, Chmielnicki Uprising, or the Khmelnytsky insurrection) was a Cossack rebellion within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 16481657, which led to the creation of a Cossack Hetmanate in Ukrainian lands. Under the command of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Zaporozhian Cossacks, allied with the Crimean Tatars and local peasantry, fought against the armies and paramilitary forces of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. The insurgency was accompanied by mass atrocities committed by Cossacks against the civilian population, especially against the Roman Catholic clergy and the Jews.  - Adam Kisiel , also Adam Kysil ( Polish : Adam Kisiel Ukrainian :    ; 1580 or 1600 - 1653 ) was a Polish nobleman , the Voivode of Kiev ( 1649 - 1653 ) and castellan or voivode of Czernihów ( 1639 - 1646 ) . He was the last Orthodox senator of the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth . Kisiel has become better known for his mediation during the Khmelnytsky Uprising .  - The Zaporozhian Cossacks, Zaporozhian Cossack Army, Zaporozhian Host or simply Zaporozhians (, ) were Cossacks who lived beyond the rapids of the Dnieper River, the land also known under the historical term Wild Fields in today's Central Ukraine. Today much of its territory is flooded by the waters of Kakhovka Reservoir.  - The Cossack Hetmanate, officially known as the Rus State or Zaporizhian Host ( , \\"Viysk Zaporozk\\"), was a Ukrainian Cossack state in Central Ukraine between 1649 and 1764 (some sources claim until 1782).

Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing. Tom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis.

Write a text based on this summary: southeast europe swelters power resources stretched in summer s first heat wave Text:","output":"Title: Southeast Europe Struggles with Power Resources amid Summer's First Heatwave Summer has officially made its presence felt in Southeast Europe as the region experiences the first heatwave of the season, stretching power resources and raising concerns regarding energy sufficiency. Sweltering heat has enveloped the countries in the region, and as power consumption has risen to match the ever-increasing demand for air conditioning and cooling systems, energy providers are scrambling to maintain a steady supply of electricity. The unprecedented heatwave is primarily affecting the countries within Southeast Europe, such as Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, and Turkey. Temperatures in these countries have soared significantly above the seasonal average and meteorologists anticipate that this trend will continue for at least the next few days. In Greece, an extreme heatwave has led to temperatures reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), causing multiple forest fires and prompting authorities to enforce strict power consumption regulations. Many fear that the heatwave could trigger memories of a similar calamity in 2007, in which numerous forest fires wreaked havoc with devastating consequences. As such, the Greek government has urged citizens to minimize the use of electrical appliances in order to alleviate the strain on the national power grid. In neighboring Bulgaria, the high temperatures have caused a power plant malfunction, thereby decreasing the country's overall power generation capacity. The country is now relying heavily on imports to meet its rapidly increasing electricity demand. Authorities have warned that if the heatwave persists, there is a risk of power outages, which could severely impact the daily lives of Bulgarian citizens. Romania, too, has witnessed a spike in electricity consumption as a result of the scorching heat, with power prices surging by around 10% in response. Serbia is working relentlessly to maintain uninterrupted power supply while contending with the impacts of climate change. Meanwhile, Croatia and Turkey are both experiencing increased electricity demand due to the soaring heat, with the latter particularly concerned about potential power shortages during the summer months. Amidst this surge in energy demand, experts have attributed the abnormally high temperatures to global warming and adverse effects of climate change. These extreme weather conditions reiterate the importance of adopting sustainable practices and committing to renewable energy solutions to mitigate potential crises in the future. In the midst of the ongoing crisis in Southeast Europe, it is crucial that governments and energy providers devise strategies to overcome the challenges posed by rising global temperatures. This may involve investing in renewable energy resources, fortifying existing power infrastructure, and encouraging citizens to adopt energy-efficient practices to lower overall consumption. As the first heatwave of the summer continues to test the power resources of Southeast Europe, countries within the region must prepare to adapt to these extreme conditions, both in the present and in anticipation of rising global temperatures in the years to come. The sweltering heat serves as a stark reminder of the ever-growing threat climate change poses to our planet, urging both local and global communities to take immediate, unified action in the pursuit of a sustainable, eco-friendly future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what are the economics of the netherlands Suggested answer: In 2009 the economy declined with 3.5%, followed by two years of mild growth. Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"Partial, as it only provides a limited view of the Netherlands' economy. The economic situation of the Netherlands involves many more aspects, and providing just a small fragment of its historical context may mislead or confuse those seeking a comprehensive understanding. The Netherlands is a highly developed, open, and export-oriented economy. In recent years, the Netherlands has consistently ranked among the world's leading economies, often appearing in the top 20 by nominal GDP and top 15 by GDP (PPP) per capita. Here's a more detailed overview of the economics of the Netherlands: 1. Industry and agriculture: The country has diverse economic sectors, including services, manufacturing, and agriculture. Major industries in the Netherlands include agro-industries, natural gas, chemicals, food, metal and engineering, electrical machinery and equipment, and tourism. 2. Trade: The Netherlands is a significant exporter, as a result of the presence of the Port of Rotterdam (Europe's largest port) and its unique geographic location. Its significant trading partners include Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. 3. Financial sector: The financial industry, particularly banking and insurance, is also crucial to the Dutch economy. Several multinational financial institutions, such as ABN AMRO and ING Group are headquartered in the Netherlands. 4. Fiscal policies and public finances: The country pursues sound fiscal policies and adheres to European policy guidelines on debt and deficit indicators. The Netherlands has successfully maintained low public debt and budget deficit levels compared to other European countries. These factors have contributed to the stability of its economy. 5. Labor market: Unemployment rates have been consistently low, oscillating around 3-4% in recent years. This indicates a healthy labor market, which contributes to the country's overall prosperity. 6. Eurozone membership: The Netherlands has been a member of the European Union since 1958 and adopted the euro (€) as its official currency in 1999. This has fostered economic integration and trade across the Eurozone region. 7. Recent economic growth: While it's true that the Dutch economy experienced a decline of 3.5% in 2009, the subsequent years witnessed a recovery, with its GDP growth rate ranging between 1-3% since 2014, which indicates a relatively stable trajectory. In conclusion, the suggested answer does not provide a sufficient overview of the economics of the Netherlands. A more accurate validation of the answer would require including more in-depth information on various economic aspects, sectors, and trends that pertain to the Dutch economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Time Warner Cable and CBS reach deal to restore network to 3m US homes CBS Corp said it has reached an agreement with Time Warner Cable Inc to end a month-long blackout of its stations. Photograph: Reuters A month-long standoff between Time Warner Cable and CBS that prevented millions of viewers from watching the top-rated network in the US ended when the two sides resolved their dispute. The deal covers more than 3m homes in New York, Dallas and Los Angeles that had not been able to receive programming from CBS or CBS-owned channels since 2 August. Broadcasting resumed Monday evening on the east coast. The companies had been fighting over how much TWC would pay for programming on CBS and other channels, including Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and the Smithsonian channel. Terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed. The agreement includes retransmission fees the cable operator pays to CBS per subscriber, which had been a sticking point. The disagreement came at a touchy time for networks and cable companies as more and more Americans are turning to alternative ways to watch TV, including online or on internet-connected TVs. Added pressure was on the two companies to reach an agreement with CBS holding deals to broadcast NFL and Southeastern Conference football, as well as the start of the US Open tennis. The blackout affected about 1.1m of New York's 7.4m television households that get CBS. An estimated 1.3m of 5.6m households in Los Angeles were blacked out, along with 400,000 of Dallas' 2.6m TV homes, CBS said. Those are three of the nation's five most populous television markets. CBS estimated the blackout cut the network's national viewership by about 1%. The talks were being closely watched beyond these companies and their customers because of the idea that a retransmission agreement would set a precedent for future negotiations between networks and cable or satellite companies. Another point of contention was the cable operator's access to CBS material for on-demand or mobile device viewing. \\"While we certainly didn't get everything we wanted, ultimately we ended up in a much better place than when we started,\\" TWC chief executive Glenn Britt said in a statement. Mignon L Clyburn, acting chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission, issued a statement saying she was \\"pleased CBS and Time Warner Cable have resolved their retransmission consent negotiations, which for too long have deprived millions of consumers of access to CBS programming\\". In the end, she added, media companies should \\"accept shared responsibility\\" for putting their audiences' interests above other interests. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"So, there was a disagreement between two big companies, Time Warner Cable and CBS, about how much money they should pay each other for showing their TV shows. This disagreement led to a month-long blackout, which means some people couldn't watch CBS TV programs on Time Warner Cable for a while. But now, the good news is that these two companies have found a solution and agreed on something, so now, around 3 million homes in the US, including in New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles can watch CBS programs again. This makes a lot of people happy, and the people who run these companies are pleased that they found a way to fix the problem."},{"instruction":"Question: The death of languages is not a new phenomenon. Languages usually have a relatively short life span as well as a very high death rate. Only a few, including Egyptian, Chinese, Greek, Latin, have lasted more than 2,000 years. What is new, however, is the speed at which they are dying out. Europe's colonial conquests caused a sharp decline in linguistic diversity, eliminating at least 15 percent of all languages spoken at the time. Over the last 300 years, Europe has lost a dozen, and Australia has only 20 left of the 250 spoken at the end of the 18th century. The rise of nation-states has also been decisive in selecting and consolidating national languages and sidelining others. By making great efforts to establish an official language in education, the media and the civil service, national governments have deliberately tried to eliminate minority languages. This process of linguistic standardization has been boosted by industrialization and scientific progress, which have imposed new methods of communication that are swift, straightforward and practical. Language diversity came to be seen as an obstacle to trade and the spread of knowledge. Monolingualism became an ideal. More recently, the internationalization of financial markets, the spread of information by electronic media and other aspects of globalization have intensified the threat to \\"small\\" languages. A language not on the Internet is a language that \\"no longer exists\\" in the modern world. It is out of the game. The serious effects of the death of languages are evident. First of all, it is possible that if we all ended up speaking the same language, our brains would lose some of their natural capacity for linguistic inventiveness. We would never be able to figure out the origins of human language or resolve the mystery of \\"the first language\\". As each language dies, a chapter of human history closes. Multilingualism is the most accurate reflection of multiculturalism. The destruction of the first will inevitably lead to the loss of the second....

Y en 1868 entró a estudiar derecho en la Universidad de Viena. Después de la lectura de Herbert Spencer, Einleitung in das Studium der Soziologie (Introducción al estudio de la sociología), comenzó a interesarse por la economía política. En el año 1875 Wieser, ál cabo de trabajar 10 años como empleado del gobierno, recibió una beca para la Universidad de Heidelberg, en Alemania, para estudiar economía política junto a Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, de quien era amigo de la juventud y más tarde sería cuñado. Ambos pasan a ser discípulos de Carl Menger, siendo este último 11 años mayor que Wieser. A pesar de que ninguno de los dos fuera alumno directo, recibieron su influencia a través de la lectura de los Grundsätze (1871), obra que les encaminó finalmente hacia el estudio de la economía política.

They first fly to Oyster Bay, New York, on Long Island, to pick up Pam's father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes (De Niro), her mother Dina (Danner) and one-year-old nephew Little Jack (the son of Bob and Debbie Banks). But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV. Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Worried that Jack may be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. Though Jack and Bernie get off to a good start, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. Things are made worse when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrnes' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses.

How can we make women feel safe in indian society? Available options: a). no b). yes The answer is:","output":"a). no While both questions are related to women's safety and rights in India, they are distinct and address different aspects of the issue. The first question, \\"What are women's rights like in India in 2014?\\" focuses on the legal framework and societal norms regarding women's rights during that specific year. To answer this question, one would typically examine the laws and government policies in place at the time to address gender inequality and ensure women's rights. This would include looking at the Constitution of India, which guarantees equality to women, as well as various acts and amendments passed in 2013 and 2014 in response to the high-profile 2012 Delhi gang-rape case. One might also analyze the enforcement of these laws and the extent to which they effectively secured women's rights in practice. Key issues to be considered in this question could include: 1. Legal rights: Examining the framework of laws and regulations that protect women's rights, such as the right to equal pay, inheritance, and property ownership. 2. Education: Assessing the access to education for girls and women in India and the efforts made to improve literacy rates. This could also include information on school enrolment and dropout rates. 3. Health: Analyzing the availability of healthcare services for women, including reproductive health and maternal health services, as well as initiatives aimed at improving women's health. 4. Political representation: Evaluating the participation of women in political decision-making, such as the number of female politicians in national and local governments, and measures implemented to encourage more women to engage in politics. 5. Social and cultural norms: Investigating the prevalence of traditional customs, practices, and attitudes that perpetuate gender discrimination and impact women's rights, such as dowry, child marriage, and gender-based violence. The second question, \\"How can we make women feel safe in Indian society?\\" is concerned with strategies and measures that can be implemented to promote a sense of security and wellbeing for women in India. This question seeks solutions to the problem of women's safety and asks what can be done to create a more inclusive and equitable society where women can safely exercise their rights. Possible measures to address women's safety in India could include: 1. Strengthening legislation: Enacting and enforcing comprehensive laws and policies to address gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination. 2. Improving law enforcement and judicial processes: Reforming police and judicial systems to ensure that cases of violence against women are handled efficiently and effectively, and that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions. 3. Promoting education and awareness: Raising awareness about women's rights and the importance of gender equality among different segments of society, including men, women, and young people. This could involve implementing gender-sensitive curricula in schools and promoting public campaigns about women's rights. 4. Empowering women: Encouraging women's participation in decision-making processes at all levels, including in politics, business, and community life, to ensure that their interests, needs, and concerns are addressed. 5. Creating safe public spaces: Implementing measures to make public spaces, such as public transport, parks, and markets, more secure for women by installing better lighting, surveillance, and policing. In conclusion, while both questions deal with the issue of women's rights and safety in India, they approach the topic from different angles and require different sets of information to answer.

Question: I do not fully understand exactly what you are asking so I will restate what I believe you are asking and then I will answer it. What was the best excuse that a student ever gave for having failed to do something? I would have to say that I was most entertained by a student’s response to “Why are you late for school?” The student said, “I awoke in time this morning but there was a mouse sitting on the edge of my bed. I looked at him and he looked back. The mouse said to me, ‘Go back to sleep’ and what could I do? He had a gun.” The following has worked a few times too when students refuse to talk. That is, I know that one of the assembled students was the culprit for some activity. When they will not talk, I interview them one at a time while the others are kept away from each other. Then when they are assembled before me again, I say, “Thank you gentlemen. I know who did it so you others are free to return to class.” All but one arises and leaves. This works more times than not. For years I have given assignments via email and I have collected assignments via email. Nothing has ever gotten lost this way and things are timestamped. I do not have to make photocopies and even students who are not present the day that the assignment is announced in class, get the assignment in a timely manner. One young lady told me, “I turned it in but you must have lost it.” “Okay,” I said, “Open your sent folder and show me that you sent it.” She replied by saying, “I delete my sent folder to keep from clogging up my email.” I told her that I understood and that she could show me an empty sent folder to prove that she was telling the truth. She said, “I lied.” Question: What happened after the student said she had turned in her assignment but the teacher must have lost it? Options: - the student admitted to bringing the assignment   - the teacher said open your sent folder   - not enough information   - the student explained that she deletes her assignment === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"The student admitted to lying about turning in the assignment.  In the detailed anecdote that was provided, the teacher had a system in place for giving and receiving assignments that eliminated excuses for loss and late submissions. The teacher would send out assignments via email and would also collect them in a similar manner. This method allowed for everything to be timestamped, thus avoiding unnecessary disputes over timing and also eliminating the need for making physical photocopies.  In this instance, when a student claimed that she had turned in her assignment but the teacher must have lost it, the teacher asked her to show proof of submission by opening her 'sent' folder. However, the student insisted that she always deleted her sent folder to avoid clogging her email. The teacher remained steadfast and offered the student an opportunity to prove her claim by simply showing an empty sent folder, implying that her regular clean-up of sent items would have resulted in the absence of the alleged sent email submission which she stated had been missed by the teacher. Under the pressure of these simple but foolproof verification tactics, the student eventually admitted to having lied about submitting the assignment. This incident highlights an effective strategy that educators can utilize to hold students accountable for their work by leveraging the technology at their disposal, also emphasizing the course of action one can take to verify the claims made by the students, ensuring academic honesty, and maintaining the integrity of the academic process. The report of a gun-wielding mouse may have been an amusing excuse for tardiness, but it appears no such creativity could bypass the teacher's email submission system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years.  He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.  For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for... contains an answer for the question: What was the name of Speer's son?, what is it ?","output":"The name of Speer's son mentioned in the article is Fritz."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV.  - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - Light Lunch was a Channel 4 lunch-time comedy chatshow broadcast on weekdays at 12:30 between March 1997 and February 1998. It starred Mel and Sue (Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc). The show was a huge success initially but audience figures declined slowly eventually resulting in low viewer figures and was deemed \\"unsatisfactory\\" by Channel 4.  - Susan Elizabeth \\"Sue\\" Perkins (born 22 September 1969) is an English comedian, broadcaster, actress and writer, born in East Dulwich, London. Originally coming to prominence through her comedy partnership with Mel Giedroyc in \\"Mel and Sue\\", she has since become best known as a radio broadcaster and TV presenter, notably of \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" (20102016) and \\"Insert Name Here\\" (2016present).  - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.  - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time.  - The Channel Islands (Norman: \\"Îles d'la Manche\\", French: \\"Îles Anglo-Normandes\\" or \\"Îles de la Manche\\") are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy. They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912  January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.  - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.  - A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duothe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stoogeis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other onethe funny man, banana man or comicis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \\"feed\\" comes from the way a straight man is wont to set up jokes and \\"feed\\" them to his partner.  - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, \\"channel 2\\" refers to the broadcast or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB). Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider.  - Insert Name Here is a British comedy panel game show presented by Sue Perkins. The programme made its debut on BBC Two on 4 January 2016. In each episode two teams of three compete to answer questions about famous people, past and present, who have just one thing in common: they share the same name. The team captains are Josh Widdicombe and Richard Osman.  - Mel Giedroyc ( born 15 June 1968 ) and Sue Perkins ( born 22 September 1969 ) , known collectively as Mel and Sue , are an English comedy double act best known for hosting their lunchtime chat shows Light Lunch and Late Lunch . More recently they have hosted the BAFTA Award - winning BBC One cookery series The Great British Bake Off .  - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.

Context: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

The London Eye is a giant cantilevered observation wheel situated on the South Bank of the River Thames in London, England. As a significant symbol of the city, it offers spectacular views of London's skyline and has become a popular tourist attraction. David Marks and Julia Barfield, a husband-and-wife architect team, designed the London Eye as their entry for a competition organized by The Sunday Times newspaper and Great Britain's Architecture Foundation in 1993. The competition was held to mark the turn of the millennium and called for innovative designs for a new public attraction. Although their design concept was not the winner, the couple took their idea forward and eventually brought it to fruition. They established the Marks Barfield Architects company, through which they managed the design and construction of the London Eye. Construction began in 1998, and the observation wheel was finally completed in 1999, opening to the public on March 9, 2000, following a technical glitch that delayed the opening. The London Eye stands at an impressive height of 135 meters (443 feet) and has a diameter of 120 meters (394 feet). It was the world's tallest Ferris wheel until 2006 when the Star of Nanchang in China surpassed it. The wheel consists of 32 sealed and climate-controlled passenger capsules, each capable of holding up to 25 people. As passengers slowly rotate around the axis, they enjoy a unique perspective of iconic landmarks, such as Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, St. Paul's Cathedral, The Shard, and the Tower of London, among others. Built with cutting-edge engineering techniques and materials, the London Eye features an A-frame design that allows it to gracefully cantilever over the Thames. The design is a blend of both modern architecture and traditional components, such as its support structure being reminiscent of a bicycle wheel with a central hub and cable spokes. Over the years, the London Eye has become not just a London icon but also one of the United Kingdom's most visited paid attractions, drawing millions of visitors from around the world annually. Further cementing its importance as a landmark, it has been featured in movies, television shows, and various cultural events. In summary, the London Eye, designed by David Marks and Julia Barfield, has become a symbol of London's innovation and creativity. This iconic landmark continues to delight and inspire visitors, offering them breathtaking views and an unforgettable experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

Jim learned that his garden is smooth while his driveway is rough by rolling a rock over them. 2. The question asks which one has less resistance. Step 1 tells us that the garden is smooth and the driveway is rough. A smooth surface generally has less resistance than a rough surface because it allows objects to slide or roll more easily. As the rock rolled more easily on the garden, it would have encountered less resistance than on the rough driveway. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) garden, as it has less resistance compared to the driveway."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Yes; Venera Gimadieva is indeed a soprano, as stated in the given information. She is specifically identified as an operatic soprano, which indicates that she is a singer with the highest voice range in the field of opera. This info was stated plainly - \\"Venera Gimadieva is a Russian operatic soprano\\" - which allows us to confidently affirm that Gimadieva is a soprano. Additionally, it's worth noting the specific type of soprano she is: a \\"lyric-coloratura.\\" This term refers to a specific type of soprano voice that is capable of executing fast, light, and agile coloratura passages, a certain type of ornamental, elaborate melody line. This term also encompasses the lyric quality of her voice, which suggests smooth and melodious singing. This extra detail does not alter the fact that she is a soprano but provides more depth to understanding her specific capabilities as a soprano. In concerts and operas, a soprano's role can often be that of the heroine, playing a crucial part in propelling the narrative, given the expressive and wide-ranging capabilities of the soprano voice. Sopranos often have exciting and challenging roles due to their significant vocal range and the dramatic possibilities this offers. Thus, being a soprano is a remarkable achievement, narratively crucial, and vocally challenging. Finally, Venera Gimadieva, apart from being a successful opera singer, is also a member of the Lake Baikal Foundation Community Board, indicating her involvement and commitment to charitable or community works. This showcases another dimension to her career – her dedication to supporting causes outside her immediate profession.

Given a choice of categories company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, the text refers to which one? A:","output":"The text refers to the category of \\"artist.\\" Specifically, it refers to Jang Woo Hyuk, a South Korean rapper who debuted in the boyband H.O.T. under SM Entertainment. The description includes key details about his dates of birth, his career in the music industry, and his association with a prominent entertainment company. The text does not mention anything related to any other category such as a company, educational institution, athlete, office holder, means of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film, or written work. Therefore, the main focus is on Jang Woo Hyuk as an artist in the music industry.  Artists, in this context, are individuals who engage in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating art. They use their creative skills in various types of art disciplines such as painting, sculpture, singing, dancing, acting, writing, filmmaking, and music. In Jang Woo Hyuk's case, his discipline is music where he has demonstrated his artistic capabilities through rap. Jang Woo Hyuk's career as a rapper and member of a boyband both align with this category. His debut with the boyband H.O.T. under SM Entertainment is particular to the music industry and describes his professional activities as an artist. In the world of real-life pop culture, the boyband H.O.T. was a significant highlight in the South Korean music scene, and Jang Woo Hyuk played a crucial role in this as one of its members.  Being an artist also implies a certain level of prominence and influence. As part of H.O.T., Jang Woo Hyuk would have gained notoriety and established a fan base. This information enhances our understanding of Jang Woo Hyuk as an artist because it establishes his impact on audiences and the music scene. Summarily, this passage refers to an 'artist.' While other categories might form part of an artist's story—like the company they work with or the albums they produce—in this instance, the text exclusively discusses Jang Woo Hyuk's role and impact as a South Korean rapper. His journey, starting from his inception in 1996 with the boyband H.O.T., qualifies him as an artist that has engaged in creating, practicing, and demonstrating the art of rap music. His mention highlights his contribution to the South Korean music industry and, by extension, his stake in the larger world of art."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tony Bushby, 19, stabbed promising student Catherine Wynter more than 20 times then left her body alone with the youngsters, who stayed locked in the house with the corpse overnight. Bushby, who was obsessed by ‘all things dark and evil’, had tricked her into a relationship by creating a circle of fictitious Facebook friends, whom he used to talk himself up and persuade her to go out with him. Tricked: Promising student Catherine Wynter was murdered whilst babysitting in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The jury heard in an earlier hearing that Miss Wynter, 19, agreed to babysit for her sister Sabrina while she spent Boxing Day night with her boyfriend and his parents. Her mother Joy Davies went to check on her just after 8am on December 27 last year and saw blood on the front door. The children, three and four, came up to her at the door and said ‘Grandma, Katie’s dead’. Catherine’s mother Joy Davis then followed a trail of blood and found her daughter lying dead on the the kitchen floor at her sister’s home in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, in a pool of her own blood. The naive churchgoer, known as Katie, had been stabbed 23 times by karate expert Bushby to her neck and stomach including 13 fatal blows, St Albans Crown Court heard.

Covered. in her blood Bushby went to his nearby family home and destroyed his. mobile to 'cover up' what had happened and destroy any evidence. Murdered: Katy's mother Joy found her daughter slumped on the floor. Police went to visit him after they examined Katie’s laptop and phone and worked out he was probably her boyfriend. They then studied his computer and. found out he had set up a fictitious circle of friends on Facebook - all. of whom he had used to communicate with Katie, tricking her they were. real. The profile pages of Dan Tress, Cyn Darwin, Shane Pleuon and Krystal Stanguard featured photographs Bushby had found on the internet. In fact they were all him and reflected his ‘obesessions and interests’ in ‘all things dark and evil’. He even went on to blame one of his creations, Dan Tress, for Katie’s murder. Another, called Krystal Stanguard, claimed she was interested in 'all things dark and evil' and a third had the email address 'lokigodtrickster@hotmail.co.uk' - named after the Norse god of chaos and mischief. Mr Speak said: 'He systematically tricked Katie over a period of time into believing that she was in contact on Facebook not only with the defendant but also with a small circle of his close friends. 'In fact this small circle of friends were entirely fictitious, they were people the defendant had made up, they did not exist. 'Believing them to be real Katie would talk to them on Facebook. All the time that girl was caught up in a web of malicious deception which was created and controlled by this defendant for purposes of his own.' Bushby used the character to say things to her to gain her trust or the say flattering or impressive things about himself. Mr Speak said: 'He used them in effect to try and get her to like him.'

Now and then water splashed on the deck and the slack sails flapped. The fresh breeze had dropped, although the sea had not yet gone down, and Marston had set the topsail and the balloon jib.

He did not move and had not been altogether conscious for some time. Rupert wore Harry's white clothes and looked, in the unsteady light, like a rather haggard and jaundiced Englishman. Marston had noted his firm touch when he fixed the bandage and now he was methodically putting back some bottles in the medicine chest.

Under Chris Kennedy's leadership of the Mart, it was the largest building in the world to be awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification in 2007 from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). The Mart has long been implementing sustainable practices. The Mart Center began operating a thermal storage facility in 1986, capable of building 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of ice per night, cooling 71 buildings in the surrounding neighborhood, and saving 200,000 in electricity costs in the first year.  In 1990, the Mart Center began using Green Seal-approved green cleaning products and the next year implemented a recycling program, which today includes all forms of paper products, glass, light bulbs, batteries, aluminum and construction materials. In 1996, the Mart Center became one of the first major property owners in downtown Chicago to enter into an agreement with the district cooling system now known as Thermal Chicago, thus contributing to the national effort to reduce the discharge of ozone-damaging CFCs.  In 2006, MMPI joined Clean Air Counts, a voluntary initiative to reduce smog forming pollutants and energy consumption in the Chicago area. Part of the campaign strategies included utilizing only low VOC cleaning products, paints and building materials, as well as energy efficient lighting and alternative workplace transportation options. To date, the Mart Center has reduced pollution by 264,018 pounds (119,757 kg), the largest reduction by a commercial building.  That same year, the Mart Center recycling program saved over 13,000 trees and recycled nearly 11 million pounds of waste, while water conservation efforts saved 5.5 million US gallons (21,000 m3) of water. More than eight percent of the estimated 10,000 people working at the Mart walk, bike or take public transportation; to encourage greener methods of transportation, the Mart expanded bicycle storage capacity to more than 200. In 2009, MMPI converted all stationery to a one hundred percent post-consumer recycled product.  The Mart has nine LEED-certified showrooms, with five others on their way to LEED certification.

Are the volcanoes on Sarahn more or less active than on Timon?  Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.  Hint: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Answer:","output":"To answer the question, I will first analyze the given paragraph and then use the information provided in it, along with the hint, to arrive at a conclusion. The paragraph mentions that the planet of Sarahn is experiencing a significant geographic shift, with many of its continents breaking apart and moving. In contrast, Timon has been a stable planet with no continental movement for a while. The hint provided informs us that when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed due to increased volcanic activity. With this information, it can be inferred that since the continents on Sarahn are currently moving, there is likely more volcanic activity occurring on the planet compared to Timon, which has stable continents and thus, less volcanic activity. Answer: The volcanoes on Sarahn are more active than on Timon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Here is a question about this article: Switzerland voted against membership in the European Economic Area in a referendum in December 1992 and has since maintained and developed its relationships with the European Union (EU) and European countries through bilateral agreements. In March 2001, the Swiss people refused in a popular vote to start accession negotiations with the EU. In recent years, the Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with those of the EU in many ways, in an effort to enhance their international competitiveness. The economy grew at 3% in 2010, 1.9% in 2011, and 1% in 2012. Full EU membership is a long-term objective of some in the Swiss government, but there is considerable popular sentiment against this supported by the conservative SVP party.

Pick your answer from: [+] None of the above choices . [+] We are running a relay race and we need fast runners . [+] I want to race the fastest because of my excellent athletic abilities . [+] It comes in handy when one is running from a police block .","output":"The reason the narrator may be happy that Kayla is the fastest girl is because they are running a relay race, and they need fast runners. The context of the story revolves around the narrator's lack of athletic prowess, specifically in a race where they need to pick up a block and bring it back in a short amount of time. By having Kayla as the fastest girl in the class, it implies that they will be able to make up for any potential shortcomings in their own performance by having a fast teammate to help carry their team to victory. In addition to this, there are psychological factors that can come into play with having a strong team member, such as increased motivation and confidence, which can ultimately contribute to improved performance. The narrator, despite feeling apprehensive about their own athletic abilities, may feel at ease knowing that they have Kayla on their side, who is known for her excellent speed. Moreover, in the context of a relay race, each participant in the team plays a crucial role in the overall success of the group. A fast runner like Kayla can help compensate for any weak links or mishaps that may occur during the race, boosting the team's chances of claiming a blue award, which the narrator mentions as their goal. This would explain why the narrator is happy that Kayla is the fastest girl in the class. The other provided options do not fit as well in the context of the given text. The narrator does not express any desire to race the fastest person due to their excellent athletic abilities, nor do they mention running from a police block, which seems unrelated to their situation. Similarly, choosing \\"None of the above choices\\" would disregard the relevance of relay racing in the plot. Therefore, the most suitable reason for the narrator's happiness about Kayla being the fastest girl is that they are running a relay race and need fast runners to have a better chance at winning the blue award."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Admitting the problem is the first major step in dealing with it. If you first recognize the signs of your problem, you can then learn to modify your behavior.  Signs and symptoms of a gambling problem include: getting a thrill from taking gambling risks, taking increasingly bigger gambling risks over time, a preoccupation with gambling, reliving past gambling experiences (through imagination or telling stories), using gambling as a way to escape problems or negative feelings, feeling guilt or remorse after gambling, and repeated failed efforts to cut back on gambling. Additional social issues associated with gambling include: taking time away from work or family life to gamble, concealing or lying about gambling, and borrowing money or stealing to gamble. Gambling excessively can cause many issues including: relationship problems, financial issues, legal problems, occupational concerns (job loss), substance use, poor health, and mental health issues (such as depression).  Do you lose time from work to gamble? Do you extend yourself beyond your means by gambling away money that you have set aside to pay your rent, mortgage, or other bills? Do you use credit cards to gamble? Are you secretive about where the money's gone to after you've gambled? Make a list of all of the consequences you have encountered due to your gambling. Also, identify people you have hurt as a result of your gambling such as family and friends. Knowing the risks of gambling may help encourage people who gamble to consider the consequences before deciding to gamble.  Excessive gambling can lead to depression, anxiety, aggression, increased suicide risk, relationship issues and stress-related illnesses.  Gambling also increases stress levels (via the stress hormone cortisol) and your heart rate, which can lead to health risks.  Pathological and addictive gambling can result in decreased decision-making skills and reduce your ability to evaluate the consequences of your actions. Don't be secretive about your finances or your gambling. Be honest with yourself and others about money spent gambling.  Pay bills immediately, when you have funds set aside to pay them.

Context: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Answer: Options: 1). using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser; 2). use just water to cleanse; 3). use abrasive soap; 4). not enough information; Answer:","output":"1). using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser;"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the album \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on?, using the article: The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October. Backed with \\"Mister Pleasant\\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group...., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The album that the song \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on is called \\"Something Else By The Kinks.\\" This album was released in 1967 and featured a progression of the band's sound by incorporating English music hall influences. \\"Death of a Clown\\" was a major UK chart success, co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, but also released as a Dave Davies solo single."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Alkan was described by Marmontel (who refers to \\"a regrettable misunderstanding at a moment of our careers in 1848\\"), as follows: We will not give the portrait of Valentin Alkan from the rear, as in some photographs we have seen. His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities. Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian Arnal: \\"[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn't get to a toilet before they stopped at Orléans. There wasn't a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing.\\" Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan \\"particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, 'des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]', as Isidore Philipp described them.\\"Alkan's aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist Frits Hartvigson that \\"Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse.\\" Stephanie McCallum has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia or obsessive–compulsive disorder.Alkan's later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to. My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can't see the point or goal.\\" A:","output":"The full name of the person whose situation makes them horridly sad and wretched is Valentin Alkan."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: How is Lumpus scared of after Lazlo goes missing?  The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts.

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes. Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have. Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid.\\" Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job. When it was over, Iwasaki had 1 million more in federal dollars and two new offices. Long Beach clients regained services they had lost years ago when federal budget cuts and dwindling grants reduced the staff of 15 lawyers to five and cut immigration and consumer law programs.

From the passage, the San Fernando Valley's legal aid program is stated to be 36 years old, while the Long Beach program is said to be 48 years old. The difference in age between the two programs is 12 years, so that part is correct, however, the original response given (\\"12 years\\") lacks context and comprehensiveness that should be inherent in a detailed and long answer. Here's a more detailed and long answer: The San Fernando Valley's legal aid program and the Long Beach program are stated to have considerable history, according to the passage. The San Fernando Valley program has been in operation for 36 years. Meanwhile, the Long Beach program has a longer history, with 48 years of operation. This highlights a difference in the establishment and potentially, the experience level of the two programs. Therefore, when we compare their ages, we can observe that the Long Beach program is older than the San Fernando Valley's legal aid program by 12 years. This age difference might explain their different levels of integration within their respective communities, outcomes in their endeavors to join with neighboring programs, and probably their varying approaches towards maintaining services for their clients."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend is Carter. His full name is Gil Carter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From the beginning the service here was so-so, the boutique is open by appointment only and whenever I attended appointments for my friend who was the bride we ended up waiting for our consultant to arrive. The store in itself is limited in selection and not in the greatest shape. I tried on a few dresses myself which were stained, had broken zippers etc... When one of the sample dresses was too large I had to be \\"clamped\\" into it (taking in the excess fabric from the back with a spring loaded clamp). Unfortunately this took with it a chunk of my flesh. I understand mistakes happen, but seriously... Ouch!  My experience as a guest of the bride was mediocre but my friends experience as the bride in question has been horrific! I've encluded her side of the story.  \\"I picked out my dress in January 2012 and got measured for it in September. I got a phone call a month later that they can't find a manufacturer to make my dress. Ok,disappointing, but I was offered a refund or the opportunity to pick a new dress. When I arrived at the salon again, there was the dress I picked out, still on the rack (and not the rack designated as sample only; the rack of dresses available to be ordered.) I asked about it and got something of a brush off answer, no real explanation. A lot of questions I asked needed to be directed to the owner, who was not answering or returning phone calls. I ended up requesting a refund as offered, but no one seemed to know how to issue one and, again, no response from the owner. I was also told they had no record of how much I needed to be refunded as my receipt was with the unreachable owner. Fortunately I had my copy with me, but still walked away with no refund. It's been a week and still no word from anyone at Iris D. Unacceptable.\\"","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as highly negative and critical. The reviewer recounts various issues they encountered during their visits to the boutique, including subpar service, limited selection, and poor condition of the dresses. They also mention a painful accident involving the clamp while trying on a dress, further affecting their overall experience. Additionally, the reviewer incorporates their friend's (the bride) perspective, which is described as 'horrific.' The bride experienced numerous issues, such as the boutique's inability to deliver the chosen dress, lack of clear communication from the staff and the owner, and problems in obtaining the refund she was promised. The overall tone of the review suggests extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment with the boutique's service, offerings, and lack of accountability."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Take a lint roller and roll it on the dog hair to pick it up from the hat. Option (b) is correct because a lint roller is meant to pick up fur, hair, and lint from fabric surfaces like hats. Lint rollers are sticky and when you roll it over the hat, the hairs will stick to the roller and come off of the hat. Think of it like how stickers stick to your shirt.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that created the flagrant denial of their consitutional rights?, using the article: On April 10, 1963, Bull Connor obtained an injunction barring the protests and subsequently raised bail bond for those arrested from 200 to 1,500 (2,000 to 10,000 in 2019). Fred Shuttlesworth called the injunction a \\"flagrant denial of our constitutional rights\\" and organizers prepared to defy the order.  The decision to ignore the injunction had been made during the planning stage of the campaign.  King and the SCLC had obeyed court injunctions in their Albany protests and reasoned that obeying them contributed to the Albany campaign's lack of success. In a press release they explained, \\"We are now confronted with recalcitrant forces in the Deep South that will use the courts to perpetuate the unjust and illegal systems of racial separation\\". Incoming mayor Albert Boutwell called King and the SCLC organizers \\"strangers\\" whose only purpose in Birmingham was \\"to stir inter-racial discord\\".  Connor promised, \\"You can rest assured that I will fill the jail full of any persons violating the law as long as I'm at City Hall.\\"The movement organizers found themselves out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. \\"I have never seen Martin so troubled\\", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: \\"The eyes of the world are on Birmingham tonight.

Q: Roland felt his stomach knotting. Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town.

I pushed on the table.","output":"A linguist would likely consider the sentence \\"I pushed on the table\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically. To offer a comprehensive evaluation, let's break down each element of the sentence and analyze their roles within the sentence structure: 1. Subject: \\"I\\" - The subject of the sentence is the personal pronoun \\"I,\\" which denotes the person performing the action. In this case, the speaker is referring to themselves. The use of the pronoun \\"I\\" is grammatically correct as the subject of the sentence. 2. Verb: \\"pushed\\" - The verb \\"pushed\\" is a past-tense form of the verb \\"to push.\\" The verb \\"to push\\" is a regular verb, and as such, its simple past tense can be formed by adding \\"-ed\\" to the base form. In this sentence, \\"pushed\\" correctly expresses the action carried out by the subject, and its past tense usage is consistent with English grammar rules. 3. Preposition: \\"on\\" - The preposition \\"on\\" is used here to specify the relationship between the verb's action (pushing) and the object being acted upon (the table). It provides clarity about where the pushing is directed. Its usage as a preposition in this context is grammatically accurate. 4. Object: \\"the table\\" - The object of the sentence is \\"the table,\\" which refers to the entity affected by the action of pushing. The definite article \\"the\\" is used correctly to denote a specific table that the speaker is referring to, and the noun \\"table\\" is an appropriate object for the action of pushing. As a result, the object usage in the sentence is considered grammatically correct. Putting the sentence together, the structure is coherent and adheres to standard English grammar rules. The subject and verb are effectively paired, and the use of the preposition and object helps create a clear expression of the action being performed. While certain linguistic perspectives might question the necessity of the preposition \\"on,\\" as \\"I pushed the table\\" can convey a similar meaning, the presence of \\"on\\" does not invalidate the sentence from a grammatical standpoint. With this analysis, a linguist would likely deem the sentence \\"I pushed on the table\\" to be a valid English sentence, both grammatically and structurally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Which department store that closed in 1987 did Bernice Bowles \\"Fitz\\" Fitz-Gibbon work at? Answer:","output":"Bernice Bowles \\"Fitz\\" Fitz-Gibbon, a highly respected advertising and marketing executive, worked at the renowned New York City department store, Gimbels, which ultimately closed its doors in 1987. Gimbels was a prominent department store in America operating from 1887 to 1987. Founded by Adam Gimbel, the store rapidly became a retail powerhouse, fueled primarily by their fierce rivalry with Macy's. The competition between Gimbels and Macy's even inspired the 1947 movie \\"Miracle on 34th Street.\\" At its peak, Gimbels had nearly 36 stores throughout New York City and its suburbs, as well as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Bernice Bowles \\"Fitz\\" Fitz-Gibbon joined Gimbels in 1930 as an advertising copywriter. Her creative and innovative copywriting style quickly earned her promotions, first to the position of Head Copywriter, then to becoming the Advertising Director in 1937. Fitz-Gibbon's work played a significant role in establishing Gimbels as a retail giant. Her keen sense of customer behavior and market trends enabled her to devise highly successful marketing campaigns and promotions. One of Fitz-Gibbon's lasting legacies at Gimbels was the introduction of the slogan, \\"Nobody but nobody undersells Gimbels,\\" emphasizing their dedication to offering the best prices in the market. Under Fitz-Gibbon's leadership, Gimbels became known for its promotional innovations, which included being one of the first department stores to introduce money-back guarantees and sales events. During her tenure at Gimbels, Fitz-Gibbon also championed women’s professional growth in advertising. She established the first-ever research department in a department store and encouraged her team to create brilliant and effective ad campaigns. Despite its many achievements, Gimbels began to falter in the mid-20th century, as the retail landscape in America changed with the rise of suburban malls and discount stores. Eventually, Gimbels succumbed to financial pressures and announced in 1986 that it would close its doors. The department store officially ceased operations in 1987. Bernice Bowles \\"Fitz\\" Fitz-Gibbon's career at Gimbels, where she worked for 18 years, significantly contributed to shaping the store's image and growth. However, with the closing of Gimbels in 1987, her impact on the company, much like the iconic department store itself, became a part of retail history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Directly after the events of Quarantine, on a flight from Los Angeles to Nashville, one of the passengers, Ralph Bundt becomes violent and attempts to enter the cockpit, demanding he be let off the plane. Ralph had been bitten by a hamster which is really a lab rat, brought onto the plane by Henry (Josh Cooke) for his school students. Ralph is restrained, but not before he bites one of the flight attendants, Paula, on the face, much to her friend, Jenny's (Mercedes Mason), horror. Disobeying orders, Captain Forrest and his co-pilot Willsy find a jetway operated by a baggage handler Ed Ramirez (Ignacio Serricchio). Everyone escapes the plane, except for the elderly couple Bev Stevens and her paralyzed mute husband Doc Stevens, and the pilots, who try to keep the violent Ralph contained in an aircraft bathroom. However, they learn that they have been locked out of the airport. Soon, armed soldiers and what appear to be CDC scientists surround the terminal. Ed shows them a door that will lead them to tarmac level but it is locked. One of the passengers, a military medic named Shilah Washington (Noree Victoria), reveals she has a medical kit in her bag in the plane's cargo hold. Jenny, Henry, Ed, Niall, and Preston sneak back into the plane to retrieve it, to find that Ralph has escaped from the bathroom, whereabouts unknown. Preston retrieves Doc and waits outside. They retrieve Shilah's kit and Niall's handgun and try to leave the hold. While in the plane, Jenny is attacked by an infected Captain Forrest and Niall shoots and kills him, but it seems that some of the captain's blood had gotten into Niall's eye. As they are leaving, they find Preston's body, and an infected Bev who tries to attack the group before they escape. When they meet up with the rest of the group, they begin to realize...

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more rushing yards did Emmitt Smith have compared to Daryl Johnston?","output":"Title: Comparing the Rushing Yards of Emmitt Smith and Daryl Johnston: A Tale of Two Legendary NFL Players Introduction Emmitt Smith and Daryl Johnston are two names that hold great significance in the world of professional football. Both players served as essential components of the Dallas Cowboys, contributing to the team's multiple Super Bowl victories in the 1990s. As running backs, Smith and Johnston were key offensive players in their respective positions. However, the differences in their roles and subsequent career statistics offer rich insights into the vast gap in their rushing yards. This article will delve deep into the career numbers of these two extraordinary athletes and provide an in-depth analysis of their contributions to the iconic Dallas Cowboys offense. Emmitt Smith – The All-Time Leading Rusher Emmitt Smith, affectionately known as the 'all-time leading rusher,' boasts a career so illustrious that it earned him a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The charismatic running back is often remembered for his incredible ability to find open spaces, evade tackles, and break free into the end zone. Over his 15-year tenure in the NFL (1990-2004), Smith amassed a staggering 18,355 rushing yards, the most in NFL history. Initially drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round of the 1990 NFL Draft, Smith had a standout rookie season, recording 937 rushing yards and earning the Offensive Rookie of the Year title. It was evident from the beginning that he was destined for greatness. Throughout his career with the Cowboys and later the Arizona Cardinals, Smith recorded a total of 11 seasons with 1,000+ rushing yards. He achieved a personal best in the 1995 season, racking up 1,773 rushing yards. Smith's impressive career résumé comprises numerous individual accolades, such as being an eight-time Pro Bowl selection, a four-time First-team All-Pro, the 1993 NFL Most Valuable Player, and the 1990s All-Decade Team honoree. Furthermore, he was instrumental in the Cowboys' three Super Bowl titles, winning the Super Bowl XXVIII MVP award along the way. Daryl Johnston – The Unsung Hero Daryl 'Moose' Johnston, on the other hand, was an exceptional fullback whose chief responsibility centered around clearing the path for Emmitt Smith. Often going unnoticed by the casual fans, Johnston's extraordinary blocking skills provided Smith with the time and space required to secure critical gains. Drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 1989 NFL Draft, Johnston's role as a fullback restricted his personal rushing yard numbers significantly. Over his 11-year NFL career (1989-1999), Johnston accumulated a total of 2,227 rushing yards, with his best season in 1994 amassing 294 rushing yards. Although his numbers may not be as eye-catching as his counterpart's, Johnston's contribution to the Dallas Cowboys' successes must not be underestimated. The two-time Pro Bowl selection (1993, 1994) was integral in paving the way for Smith's record-shattering accomplishments. The Great Divide Comparing the rushing yard figures of the two players reveals a stark difference. Emmitt Smith's career total of 18,355 rushing yards overshadows Daryl Johnston's 2,227 by a whopping 16,128 yards. This immense disparity can be attributed to the distinct roles each player upheld within the team. Smith, as the feature running back, received the lion's share of carries and opportunities to accumulate rushing yards, whereas Johnston sacrificed personal statistics for the betterment of the team, creating running lanes for Smith through gritty, unglamorous work. It is essential not to discount Johnston's impact, but we cannot ignore the staggering difference in rushing yard numbers. Conclusion In conclusion, this in-depth comparison showcases the wide chasm that exists between Emmitt Smith's 18,355 career rushing yards and Daryl Johnston's 2,227. Despite the significant difference, both players contributed in their unique ways to the success of the Dallas Cowboys in the 1990s. As fans and analysts look back on their storied careers, it is crucial to remember that their roles and contributions created a dynamic partnership that ultimately helped shape the decade's iconic Dallas Cowboys squad."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. What sorts of items does the author tend to store in the garage in containers? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - items that are used very infrequently but are still needed - things that they use every day - not enough information - stuff they intend to give to friends and family","output":"The author tends to store in the garage, in containers, items that are used very infrequently but are still needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to make logical assumptions, we need to first understand the premise of the available information. Here is a brief explanation of the two events: 1. \\"People are watching a magic show.\\": This statement offers a scenario where an audience is present, and they are watching a magic show, which typically involves a magician or a group of magicians performing tricks and illusions for entertainment purposes. 2. \\"A band is having their live show recorded.\\": This statement presents a situation where a musical group, known as a band, is performing a live show, and this performance is being recorded in some manner, either audio or video (or possibly both). From this understanding, it is apparent that the context of both statements is entirely different; one is related to the performance of magic tricks, while the other is associated with a live music performance. Each event revolves around a distinct type of performer (magicians vs. musicians) and a different form of entertainment (magic vs. music). There is no connection between people watching a magic show and a band having their live show recorded. To assert that there is a link between these two situations would require additional information that demonstrates their relationship, such as: - The events are happening at the same venue where a music performance might precede or follow the magic show. - The magic show event incorporates live music by a band, and this joint performance is being recorded. However, the statement \\"People are watching a magic show.\\" on its own does not provide enough information to establish any connection or lead to the conclusion that \\"A band is having their live show recorded.\\" It would be erroneous to make such an assumption based solely on the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Food processors are not the best for mixing small amounts of foods. The wider work bowl of a processor makes it more suitable for larger, bulk processing over the blender. Use your food processor when making larger meals that might involve grating cheese, chopping vegetables or kneading pie crusts. Unlike blenders, food processors have razor sharp blades. A food processor is much more versatile and is suitable for dealing with non-liquid, heavier foods. Pick the type of blade you would like to use, the S blade is best for chopping vegetables, and attach it on the inside of the food processor. You can prep vegetables, and it's also an easy way to chop onions without crying. The food processor will chop, julienne, pulverize, mash, and split foods. Your blender, on the other hand, will probably start smoking if you force it to try to do these things. Attach the grating disc, also called the shredding disc, to the top of the bowl on your food processor. Use this attachment to grate cheese, bread or vegetables. Put nuts without their shells into your food processor when using the grinding blade. The food processor will soon turn the nuts into butter. Pick a food processor that's solid and sturdy if you plan to use it to knead dough. Connect the kneading attachment to knead dough for pie crusts and more.

The title of \\"world's oldest airport\\" is disputed, but College Park Airport in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright, is generally agreed to be the world's oldest continually operating airfield, although it serves only general aviation traffic. Bisbee-Douglas International Airport in Arizona was declared \\"the first international airport of the Americas\\" by US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington had a dirigible land in 1905 and planes in 1911 and is still in use. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916 as a military airfield, but only accepted civil aircraft from December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport in Sydney, Australia—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world's oldest continually operating commercial airports.

Read this and answer the question European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines and/or chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular music  styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles lend themselves to the song form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can attain a high level of complexity. What method is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches, tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music?","output":"Composers use the system of staff notation to prescribe to performers the pitches (such as melodies, basslines, and chords), tempo, meter, and rhythms for a piece of music. Staff notation, which has been in use since about the 16th century, is a visual representation of music that utilizes symbols to indicate pitches, duration of notes, and various other performance aspects. This method is predominantly found in European art music and allows for a greater degree of precision and complexity in musical compositions, setting it apart from many non-European and popular musical forms that often involve improvisation and ornamentation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
