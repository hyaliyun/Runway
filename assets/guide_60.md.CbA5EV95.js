However, we find that existing RAG systems are inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multihop queries. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multihop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. We detail the procedure of building the dataset, utilizing an English news article dataset as the underlying RAG knowledge base. We demonstrate the benchmarking utility of MultiHopRAG in two experiments. The first experiment compares different embedding models for retrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we examine the capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in reasoning and answering multi-hop queries given the evidence. Both experiments reveal that existing RAG methods perform unsatisfactorily in retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We hope MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable resource for the community in developing effective RAG systems, thereby facilitating greater adoption of LLMs in practice. The MultiHopRAG and implemented RAG system is publicly available at https://github.com/yixuantt/ MultiHop-RAG/. 1 Introduction The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has fostered a wide range of innovations, powering intelligent chatbots and other natural language processing (NLP) applications (OpeFigure 1: RAG with multi-hop query. nAI, 2023). One promising use case is RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) (Asai et al., 2023), which optimizes the output of a large language model by referencing an external knowledge base outside of the LLM training data sources before generating a response. RAG improves LLM’s response (Borgeaud et al., 2022) and also mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, thereby enhancing the models’ credibility (Gao et al., 2023). LLMbased frameworks, such as LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022) and LangChain (Chase, 2022), specialize in supporting RAG pipelines. In real-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, a user’s query often necessitates retrieving and reasoning over evidence from multiple documents, a process known as multi-hop query. For instance, consider financial analysis using a database of financial reports. A financial analyst might query, Which company among Google, Apple, and Nvidia reported the largest profit margins in their third-quarter reports for 2023? or inquire about a specific company’s performance over time, such as How does Apple’s sales trend look over the past three years? These queries require evidence from multiple documents to formulate an answer. Due to the multifaceted nature of such queries, involving information from various sources, traditional similarity matching methods like cosine similarity between query and financial arXiv:2401.15391v1 [cs.CL] 27 Jan 2024 News source Fortune Magazine The Sydney Morning Herald Evidence Back then, just like today, home prices had boomed for years before Fed officials were ultimately forced to hike interest rates aggressively in an attempt to fight inflation. Postponements of such reports could complicate things for the Fed, which has insisted it will make upcoming decisions on interest rates based on what incoming data say about the economy. Claim Federal Reserve officials were forced to aggressively hike interest rates to combat inflation after years of booming home prices. The Federal Reserve has insisted that it will base its upcoming decisions on interest rates on the incoming economic data. Bridge-Topic Interest rate hikes to combat inflation Interest rate decisions based on economic data Bridge-Entity Federal Reserve Federal Reserve Query Does the article from Fortune suggest that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes are a response to past conditions, such as booming home prices, while The Sydney Morning Herald article indicates that the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate decisions will be based on incoming economic data? Answer Yes Table 1: An example of a multi-hop query, including supporting evidence from two news articles, the paraphrased claim, the bridge-topic and bridge-entity, and the corresponding answer. report chunk embeddings might not yield optimal results. We demonstrate this multi-hop retrieval process in Figure 1. However, existing RAG benchmarks, such as RGB (Chen et al., 2023) and RECALL (Liu et al., 2023), mainly evaluate a simple case where the answer of a query can be retrieved and solved using one single piece of evidence. None of these benchmarks assess the retrieval and reasoning capability of LLMs for complex multi-hop queries. To address this gap and make RAG benchmarking more closely resemble real-world scenarios, in this paper, we introduce MultiHop-RAG. To our knowledge, MultiHop-RAG is one of the first RAG datasets focusing specifically on multi-hop queries. Based on the RAG queries commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, we first categorize multi-hop queries into four types: Inference query, Comparison query, Temporal query, and Null query. The first three types — Inference, Comparison, and Temporal — require the retrieval and analysis of evidence from multiple sources, encompassing tasks like inferring relationships, comparing data points, and sequencing events over time. The Null query represents a scenario where the query cannot be derived from the knowledge base. This category is crucial for assessing whether an LLM might hallucinate an answer to a multi-hop query when the retrieved text lacks relevance. We construct our RAG knowledge base using a collection of news articles. Using GPT-4 as a data generator, we then take an extensive procedure to construct a diverse set of multi-hop queries, each requiring the retrieval and reasoning over multiple documents. An example of query construction is shown in Table 1. First, we begin by extracting factual sentences from each news article as evidence. For example, an extracted piece of evidence from an article may state: “Back then, just like today, home prices had boomed for years before Fed officials were ultimately forced to hike interest rates aggressively in an attempt to fight inflation.” Second, we input each evidence piece into GPT-4, prompting it to rephrase the evidence into a claim. This claim is clarified with a disambiguated topic and entity. For instance, GPT-4 might rephrase the aforementioned evidence into: “Federal Reserve officials were forced to aggressively hike interest rates to combat inflation after years of booming home prices”, identifying “Interest rate hikes to combat inflation” as the topic and “Federal Reserve” as the entity. These topics and entities act as bridges for constructing multi-hop queries, known as bridge-topic or bridge-entity. Next, we use GPT4 to generate specific multi-hop queries related to the same bridge-topic or bridge-entity, accompanied by the correct answers. Lastly, we undertake a validation step to ensure the data quality. We demonstrate the benchmarking capabilities of MultiHop-RAG using two experiments, utilizing a RAG system implemented with LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022). The first experiment involves a comparison of different embedding models for retrieving relevant evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we assess the reasoning and answering abilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM, Claude-2, Llama2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B, for multi-hop queries when retrieved text is provided. The results from both experiments indicate that the current RAG implementations are inadequate for effectively retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We publicly release this challenging MultiHop-RAG dataset and hope it will be a valuable resource for the community in developing and benchmarking RAG systems, thereby unleashing the great potential of generative AI in practice. 2 RAG with multi-Hop queries 2.1 Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) In an RAG application, we utilize an external corpus, denoted as D, which comprises multiple documents and serves as the knowledge base. Each document within this corpus, represented as di ∈ D, is segmented into a set of chunks.These chunks are then transformed into vector representations using an embedding model and stored in an embedding database. Given a user query q, the system typically retrieves the top-K chunks that best match the query. These chunks constitute the retrieval set for query q, represented as Rq = {r1, r2, ..., rK}. The retrieved chunks, combined with the query and an optional prompt, are then fed into an LLM to generate a final answer, following the format: LLM(q, Rq, prompt) → answer. 2.2 Multi-Hop Query We define a multi-hop query as one that requires retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence to provide an answer. In other words, for a multi-hop query q, the chunks in the retrieval set Rq collectively provide an answer to q. For example, the query \\"Which company among Google, Apple, and Nvidia reported the largest profit margins in their third-quarter reports for 2023?\\" requires 1) retrieving relevant pieces of evidence related to profit margins from the reports of the three companies; 2) generating an answer by comparing and reasoning from the multiple pieces of retrieved evidence. This differs from a singlehop query such as \\"What is Google’s profit margin in the third-quarter reports for 2023,\\" where the answer can be directly derived from a single piece of evidence. Based on the queries commonly used in realworld RAG systems, we identify four types of multi-hop queries. For each type, we present a hypothetical query within the context of a financial RAG system, where the knowledge base consists of a collection of annual reports. Inference query: For such a query q, the answer is deduced through reasoning from the retrieval set Rq. An example of an inference query might be: Which report discusses the supply chain risk of Apple, the 2019 annual report or the 2020 annual report? Comparison query: For such a query q, the answer requires a comparison of evidence within the retrieval set Rq. For instance, a comparison query might ask: Did Netflix or Google report higher revenue for the year 2023?\\" Temporal query: For such a query q, the answer requires an analysis of the temporal information of the retrieved chunks. For example, a temporal query may ask: Did Apple introduce the AirTag tracking device before or after the launch of the 5th generation iPad Pro? Null query: For such as query q, the answer cannot be derived from the retrieved set Rq. We include the null query to assess the generation quality, especially regarding the issue of hallucination. For a null query, even though a retrieved set is provided, an LLM should produce a null response instead of hallucinating an answer. For example, assuming ABCD is a non-existent company, a null query might ask: What are the sales of company ABCD as reported in its 2022 and 2023 annual reports? 2.3 Evaluation Metrics An RAG system handling multi-hop queries can be assessed from two key aspects: retrieval evaluation and generation evaluation. Retrieval Evaluation: Evidently, the quality of the retrieval set Rq determines the final generation quality. We compare the retrieved set with the ground truth evidence associated with each query, except for the null queries, as they have no evidence to derive from. Assuming the topK chunks are retrieved, i.e., |Rq| = K, we use retrieval evaluation metrics including Mean Average Precision at K (MAP@K), Mean Reciprocal Rank at K (MRR@K), and Hit Rate at K (Hit@K). MAP@K measures the average top-K retrieval precision across all queries. MRR@K calculates the average of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant chunk for each query, considering the top-K retrieved set. Hit@K metric measures the fraction of evidence that appears in the top-K retrieved set. Response Evaluation: Since the multi-hop query requires reasoning over multiple pieces of retrieved chunks, we can also evaluate the reasoning capability of the LLM by comparing the LLM response with the ground truth answer of the query. Figure 2: MultiHop-RAG Construction Pipeline. 3 A Benchmarking Dataset: MultiHop-RAG In this section, we provide detailed information on the construction of the MultiHop-RAG dataset. Specifically, we describe the process of creating a set of multi-hop queries, along with the corresponding ground truth evidence sets and answers derived from a collection of news articles. 3.1 MultiHop-RAG Construction Step 1: Dataset Collection. We download a news dataset using the mediastack API 1 , a REST API interface delivering worldwide news data. The news data source comprises various English-language websites covering a range of news categories: entertainment, business, sports, technology, health, and science. To mimic real-world RAG scenarios, where the knowledge base data, such as an enterprise’s internal data, may differ from the LLMs’ training data, we select news articles published from September 26, 2023, to December 26, 2023. This timeframe extends beyond the knowledge cutoff of some widely-used LLMs, including ChatGPT and LLaMA, as of the time of writing. This selection also helps in teasing out the possibility of the underlying LLM having been exposed to these news articles. We only keep articles with a token length greater than or equal to 1,024. Every 1 https://mediastack.com/ news article is paired with metadata, including the title, publish date, author, category, URL, and news source. Step 2: Evidence Extraction. For each article, we extract factual or opinion sentences using a trained language model 2 . These factual sentences are later used as evidence for answering multi-hop queries. We retain only those news articles containing evidence that may have overlapping keywords with other news articles. This allows us to later create multi-hop queries where the answer’s evidences are drawn from multiple sources. Step 3: Claim, Bridge-Entity, Bridge-Topic Generation. Our goal is to use GPT-4 to automatically generate high-quality multi-hop queries using the evidence set. However, the raw evidence obtained from Step 2 is not ideal for query generation due to inconsistency in linguistic structure. For example, some pieces of evidence use pronouns to refer to subjects and lack the actual entity in the text. To address this, we employ GPT-4 to paraphrase the evidence, which we refer to as claims, given the original evidence and its context. To ensure consistency between the generated claim and the evidence, we further perform fact-checking using the UniEval (Zhong et al., 2022) framework to verify the alignment between the evidence and claim. Appendix A presents the prompt used for GPT-4 for claim generation. Bridge-Entity and Bridge-Topic: The shared entity or topic across pieces of evidence is referred to as the bridge-entity or bridge-topic. These bridgeentities or bridge-topics can be used to link different pieces of evidence from which a multi-hop query’s answer is derived. For example, in a claim such as “Google reports its third-quarter results for 2023, showcasing a detailed overview of its financial performance, including revenue growth, profit margins”, the term profit margin can be viewed as a bridge-topic and the term Google can be viewed as a bridge-entity that links the different pieces of evidence. We prompt GPT-4 to identify the bridgeentity and bridge-topic for each claim. Appendix A also presents the prompt used for GPT-4 for bridge generation. Step 4: Query and Answer Generation. In this step, we leverage the bridge-entity or bridge-topic to generate multi-hop queries. Specifically, we first group the claims having the same bridge-entity or 2 https://huggingface.co/lighteternal/fact-or-opinion-xlmrel bridge-topic into a claim set. We restrict the claim set to have at least two claims but no more than four claims. For each type of query, we feed the claim set to GPT-4 and prompt it with an instruction to generate a query with information from each claim. Below, we explain the specifications for different multi-hop query types. In the construction of each query, we also include the source of the news article where the supporting evidence is associated with to mimic real-world RAG scenarios. Appendix A presents the prompts used for GPT-4 for query generation. Inference Query: These queries are formulated by synthesizing the various characterizations of the bridge-entity across multiple claims, with the final answer being the identification of the entity itself. Comparison Query: These queries are structured to compare the similarities and differences related to the bridge entity or topic. The resultant answer to such queries is typically a definitive “yes” or “no”, based on the comparison. Temporal Query: These queries explore the temporal ordering of events across different points in time. The answer to such queries is typically a “yes” or “no” or a single temporal indicator word like “before” or “after”. Null Query: Null query is a query whose answer cannot be derived from the retrieved set. To create null queries, we generate multi-hop queries using entities that do not exist in the existing bridgeentities. To add complexity, we also include fictional news source metadata when formulating these questions, ensuring that the questions do not reference any contextually relevant content from the knowledge base. The answer to the null query should be “insufficient information” or similar. Step 5: Quality Assurance. Finally, we use two approaches to reassure the dataset quality. First, we manually review a subset sample of the generated multi-hop queries, their corresponding evidence sets, and the final answers. The results of the manual examination indicate a high degree of accuracy and data quality. Second, we utilize GPT-4 to assess each example in the dataset against the following criteria: 1) The generated query must utilize all provided evidence in formulating the response; 2) The query should be answerable solely based on the provided evidence; 3) The response to the generated query should be either a single word or a specific entity; 4) The query must conform to its designated query type.

The distribution of the news categories is shown in Table 2. MultiHopRAG contains four types of multi-hop queries and the distribution of these queries is shown in Table 3. In total, about 88% of queries in the dataset are non-null queries where answers can be retrieved and reasoned from the knowledge base. In addition, the form of queries exhibits considerable diversity. Approximately 27% of interrogative queries start with \\"does,\\" around 15% initiate with \\"what,\\" a similar proportion start \\"which,\\" and 14% begin with \\"who,\\" with the remainder incorporating a small percentage of other interrogative words such as \\"when.\\" Moreover, the number of evidence required to answer a multi-hop query varies. Table 4 shows the distribution of evidence numbers for each query in the dataset. Around 42% of queries can be answered using two pieces of evidence, while approximately 30% and 15% of queries can be answered using three or four pieces of evidence, respectively. 4 Benchmarking RAG system using MultiHop-RAG MultiHop-RAG can be used as a benchmark for various RAG-related tasks.

A retrievalrelated task focuses on retrieving relevant text from the knowledge base, while a generation-related task focuses on generating high-quality responses given the retrieved text. In this section, we showcase two use cases for each task where MultiHop-RAG can be employed. 4.1 Retrieval-related Task An important design choice in an RAG system is the selection of the embedding model. An embedding model converts data into numerical vectors and subsequently stores these vectors in embedding databases. In this experiment, we evaluate different embedding models by examining their retrieval quality. Experiment Setup: We implement an RAG system using the LlamaIndex framework (Liu, 2022). We partition the documents in the MultiHop-RAG knowledge base into chunks, each consisting of 256 tokens. We then convert the chunks using an embedding model and save the embeddings into a vector database. Similarly, in the retrieval step, we convert a query using the same embedding model and retrieve the top-K most relevant chunks that have the highest cosine similarity with the query embedding. In this experiment, we test a variety set of embedding models, including the ada-embeddings by OpenAI (text-embedding-ada-002, text-search-adaquery-001), voyage-02 3 , llm-embedder (Zhang et al., 2023), bge-large-en-v1.5 (Xiao et al., 2023), jina-embeddings-v2-base-en (Günther et al., 2023), e5-base-v2 (Wang et al., 2022), and instructor-large (Su et al., 2023). NULL queries are excluded in this experiment because there is no matching evidence to the query. Additionally, we also include a Reranker module to examine the retrieval performance, using bge-reranker-large (Xiao et al., 2023). After retrieving 20 related chunks using the em3 https://www.voyageai.com/ bedding model, we further select the top-K chunks using the Reranker. Experiment Result: Table 5 shows the retrieval result of using different embedding models. It shows that there is still a significant gap in retrieving relevant evidence for the multi-hop queries. While Rerank can effectively improve retrieval relevance, the highest Hits@10 is only 0.7467 when the Reranker technique is used. Moreover, the drop in the highest Hits@4 to 0.6625 is worrisome. In practical RAG systems, the underlying LLM often has a context window limit. As a result, the number of retrieved chunks is usually restricted to a small number. The low values of the retrieval metrics highlight the challenges in retrieving relevant pieces of evidence for multi-hop queries when using direct similarity matching between the multihop query and text chunks. 4.2 Generation-related Task The underlying LLMs play a crucial role in generating responses in an RAG system. In this experiment, we evaluate the quality of generated responses under two different settings. In the first setting, we employ the best-performing retrieval model, namely voyage-02 with bge-reranker-large, as indicated in Table 5, to retrieve the top-K texts and then feed them into the LLM. In the second setting, we use the ground-truth evidence associated with each query as the retrieved text for the LLM. This setting represents a ceiling performance for testing the LLM’s response capabilities, as it utilizes the actual evidences. Experiment Setup: In the first experiment, we retrieve top-6 chunks so that the total length of the retrieved text does not exceed 2,048. All queries in MultiHop-RAG are tested in the experiment. In the second experiment, since the null queries do not have associated evidence, we exclude this type of query in the experiment. For the LLMs used in the experiment, we consider state-of-theart commercial models, including GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), GPT-3.5, Claude-2 (Anthropic, 2023), and Google-PaLM (Google, 2023). We obtain answers using the provided API of the respective models. We also assess some open-source models, including Mixtral-8x7b-instruct (Jiang et al., 2024) and Llama-2-70b-chat-hf (Touvron et al., 2023). Experiment Results: Table 6 shows the response accuracy of different LLMs. First, we can see that the response accuracy rate using the retrieved Embedding Without Reranker With bge-reranker-large MRR@10 MAP@10 Hits@10 Hits@4 MRR@10 MAP@10 Hits@10 Hits@4 text-embedding-ada-002 0.4203 0.3431 0.6381 0.504 0.5477 0.4625 0.7059 0.6169 text-search-ada-query-001 0.4203 0.3431 0.6399 0.5031 0.5483 0.4625 0.7064 0.6174 llm-embedder 0.2558 0.1725 0.4499 0.3189 0.425 0.3059 0.5478 0.4756 bge-large-en-v1.5 0.4298 0.3423 0.6718 0.5221 0.563 0.4759 0.7183 0.6364 jina-embeddings-v2-base-en 0.0621 0.031 0.1479 0.0802 0.1412 0.0772 0.1909 0.1639 intfloat/e5-base-v2 0.1843 0.1161 0.3556 0.2334 0.3237 0.2165 0.4176 0.3716 voyage-02 0.3934 0.3143 0.6506 0.4619 0.586 0.4795 0.7467 0.6625 hkunlp/instructor-large 0.3458 0.265 0.5717 0.4229 0.5115 0.4118 0.659 0.5775 Table 5: Retrieval performance of different embedding models.

This is expected, because the retrieval component falls short in retrieving relevant evidences from the knowledge base. Second, even when we provide the LLM with the ground-truth evidences, we can see that the response accuracy is far from being perfect. Open source LLM such as Llama02-70B and Mixtral-8x7B only achieve an accuracy of 0.32 and 0.36 respectively. GPT-4 achieves strong reasoning capability with an accuracy of 0.89, followed by the second-based LLM Google-PaLM with an accuracy of 0.74. Figure 3 shows the detailed results of different query types for GPT-4 and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct. Both models show relatively high robustness on null queries, meaning they are generally good at determining when a query cannot be answered based on the retrieved text. This is encouraging because one benefit of RAG is to mitigating the LLM hallucination issue by augmenting LLM with retrieval knowledge. However, Mixtral-8x7B model performs significantly worse than the GPT-4 in comparison and temporal queries. Upon reviewing the incorrect responses, we find that Mixtral-8x7B fails to accurately handle logical negation, leading to misinterpretation of statements and thus a low performance in the comparison queries. In addition, Mixtral-8x7B often fails to correctly identify Figure 3: Generation accuracy for different query types. the chronological order of events, which is crucial for answering temporal queries where timing is a key factor. Taken together, this experiment demonstrates that there is still room for improvement in the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly those that are open-source, for multi-hop queries. 4.3 Other Use Cases Beyond embedding models and LLM generation, there are other areas worth exploring. For example, query decomposition is a widely utilized technique in RAG frameworks, such as LLamaIndex. This process involves breaking down the query into smaller segments; it targets a single document for retrieval and integrates the information subsequently, thereby potentially enhancing retrieval accuracy. Another advanced and promising approach involves building LLM-based agents that can automatically plan and execute multi-hop queries, such as AutoGPT (Gravitas, 2023). Another area of interest is the hybrid retrieval approach, which combines keyword and embedding matching tech- niques. We believe that there are many potential areas for enhancing RAG’s performance on multihop queries, and the curated dataset MultiHopRAG can be a valuable resource to the community. 5 Related Work RAG Evaluation: As RAG systems gain increasing popularity, a variety of RAG benchmarking datasets and evaluation tools have been developed. For instance, RGB (Chen et al., 2023) and RECALL (Liu et al., 2023) evaluate the performance of LLMs in generating responses for RAG systems under conditions involving noisy, integrative, and counterfactual queries. However, both datasets primarily focus on evaluating the generation aspect of RAG systems without specifically addressing their retrieval accuracy. In addition, recent advancements have been made in automated RAG evaluation tools, such as ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2023) and RAGAS (Es et al., 2023). These tools utilize LLMs to automatically assess the quality of RAG generation, yet they do not introduce benchmarking datasets. Our work introduces one of the first RAG benchmarking datasets, consisting of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence, thereby complementing existing RAG evaluations. Retrieval datasets: Apart from the context of RAG, several benchmarking datasets exist for information retrieval evaluation. The FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) dataset, for instance, contains claims classified as Supported, Refuted, or NotEnoughInfo by the given Wikipedia article (Thorne et al., 2018). Similarly, the SciFact dataset comprises scientific claims paired with evidencecontaining abstracts (Wadden et al., 2020). However, the claims in both datasets are single-hop statements, and the supporting evidence is from one single article, in contrast to the multi-hop queries discussed in this paper. Another dataset, HoVer, involves claims that require extracting and reasoning from multiple Wikipedia articles (Jiang et al., 2020). However, unlike our dataset, HoVer focuses solely on classifying claims as either supported or not supported by the articles without evaluating an LLM generation step. Moreover, in HoVer, the Wikipedia articles from which evidence is drawn are given for claim verification, which is significantly different from our setting, where relevant pieces of evidence need to be extracted from a large knowledge base. Separately, (Kamalloo et al., 2023) evaluates a range of commercial embedding APIs for information retrieval, but this evaluation is not contextualized within the framework of RAG systems either. Multi-document QA datasets: Questionanswering (QA) is a fundamental task in NLP, and several popular benchmarks, such as HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MultiRC (Khashabi et al., 2018), and 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), aim to achieve QA from multiple sources of documents. This task is similar to our multi-hop query RAG task, as both involve reasoning from multiple sources of information. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing a model’s reasoning skills, and they do not emphasize the retrieval of evidence from a knowledge base. Additionally, their primary data sources Wikipedia, significantly overlap with the training data of most existing LLMs. If we use these sources for benchmarking RAG systems, there is a potential concern that LLM responses might rely on training knowledge rather than reasoning from the retrieved knowledge base. 6 Conclusion In this work, we introduce MultiHop-RAG, a novel and unique dataset designed for queries that require retrieval and reasoning from multiple pieces of supporting evidence. These types of multi-hop queries represent user queries commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. MultiHop-RAG consists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. This paper details the creation process of MultiHop-RAG, employing a hybrid approach that integrates human effort with GPT-4. Additionally, we explore two use cases of MultiHop-RAG in the benchmarking of RAG systems, thereby highlighting the potential applications of this dataset. By publicly releasing MultiHop-RAG, we aim to provide a valuable resource to the community, contributing to the advancement and benchmarking of RAG systems. Limitations This work has several limitations that can be improved in future research. First, our ground truth answers are restricted to simple responses such as “yes\\", “no\\", entity names, or temporal indicators like “before\\" or “after\\" to facilitate the use of a straightforward accuracy metric for evaluating generation performance. Future work could consider allowing free text as answers and employing more sophisticated metrics to assess generation quality. Second, the current dataset limits supporting evidence for a query to a maximum of four pieces. Future work can extend the dataset by including queries that require retrieving and reasoning from even more evidence. Lastly, while our experiments utilize a basic RAG framework using LlamaIndex, future work could involve evaluating the answering of multi-hop queries using more advanced RAG frameworks or LLM-agent frameworks.

A Appendix A: GPT-4 Prompts Used for Data Generation We present the prompts used for guiding GPT-4 for data generation. Table 7 shows the prompt used for claim generation, along with the corresponding topics and entities within these claims. Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10 respectively show the prompts used for generating multi-hop queries of the inference, comparison, and temporal types. B Appendix B: Dataset Examples In this appendix, we present an example of each type of multi-hop query included in the MultiHopRAG dataset. These examples are illustrated in the respective tables: Table 12 for Inference Queries, Table 13 for Comparison Queries, Table 14 for Temporal Queries, and Table 15 for Null Queries. Each query is paired with a ground-truth answer for the evaluation of generation accuracy, while multiple pieces of supporting evidence are included for assessing retrieval performance. Additionally, metadata such as the title, source, and publication time of the news articles are provided as references. A \\"claim\\" is a statement or assertion made within a text expressing a belief, opinion, or fact. Given evidence from the original context, please extract one claim and its associated topics. Note: The claim should not contain ambiguous references, such as ’he’,’ she,’ and’ it’, and should use complete names. If there are multiple topics, give the most dominant one. The target of the claim (one entity)is the specific individual, group, or organization that the statement or assertion within a text is directed towards or about which it is making a case. The topic of the claim should be a simple phrase representing the claim’s central argument concept. If there is no claim, please leave it blank. Please generate a claim based on the given evidence. Don’t generate the evidence yourself. Please give the response following this format: Evidence: [original context] Claims: [extract claim] Claim Target: [target] Claim Topic: [topic] Here are examples: <examples> Now, it’s your turn. <News> <evidence> Table 7: Claim Generation Prompting A multi-hop question is a query requiring multiple inferential leaps or accessing several pieces of information from different locations or sources to arrive at an answer. The following are news articles’ metadata and claims come from the articles. All the claims from the article are related to a similar target. Your task is to generate one multi-hop inference question based on the claims. Here are some instructions: 1. Find the Connection: The connection between claims is <target>, which is how these key pieces of information are related or how they can be combined to form a more complex idea. 2. Formulate the Question: Create a question that cannot be answered by relying on just one of the sentences but instead requires understanding and linking the information from all of the sources. The answer is <target>. 3. Ensure Coherence: Make sure the question flows logically from the combined information and is clear and unambiguous. 4. Use the keywords: <key set> <examples> Context: <Context> Table 8: Inference Query Generation Prompting <Context> The above are news articles’ metadata and claims come from the articles. All the claims from the articles are related to a similar target. Your task is to generate one comparison question based on all the claims from different sources. This question needs to compare some factual elements of the claims that are explicitly stated to find where they agree or differ. The correct answer to this question is expressed as a comparative adjective, a statement of alignment, a simple yes or no. To generate a comparative question from claims, you need to use the following keywords: <key set> The Good Comparison Questions: <examples> Your Comparison Question: Table 9: Comparison Query Generation Prompting <Context> Please create a time-sensitive comparison question using metadata and excerpts from multiple news articles. That is to compare the consistency or sequence of reports on similar topics at multiple different time points. If it is to compare the consistency, please clearly mention the news source and time in the question using <time frame>. If it is to compare sequences of reports, just clearly mention the news source and do not mention the timeline. Utilize the following keywords provided in the <key set> to construct the question. The correct answer should based on the factual excerpts and is only one word. <examples> Your time-sensitive comparison question: Table 10: Temporal Query Generation Prompting A multi-hop question is a query requiring multiple inferential leaps or accessing several pieces of information from different locations or sources to arrive at an answer. Considering you have read at least two news articles on <entity>, construct a multi-hop question that incorporates all the news sources. The source of the news should be stated in the question. Also, ensure that the answer to the question is a single word/entity. Do not answer this question directly. Just give me the question: Table 11: Null Query Generation Prompting Query: Which platform is at the center of discussions in articles from Music Business Worldwide, Polygon, and FOX News - Health, concerning the policing of AI-driven voice replication, the debate over \\"reaction\\" content, and being the most used app overnight by young people?

Answer: Insufficient information. Table 15: The example of negative rejection questions\\"\\"","output":"This document explains a complex research paper. The research paper focuses on something called MultiHop-RAG: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-Hop Queries**. Imagine you're having a conversation and you ask a smart friend (like Siri or Google) two related questions about different things. For instance, you might ask, \\"When did Company A release its new product?\\" and then \\"Which product had better reviews, Company A's or Company B's?\\" Your friend needs to remember what you asked before (company names, product info, dates, reviews, etc.) and then answer your current question using all that info. MultiHop-RAG is a way to make computers do this kind of complex question-answering. It does so by looking up (retrieving) information from a big pool of knowledge and then putting that info together (generating) to answer questions that need multiple steps or pieces of evidence. This is particularly tricky because it’s like putting together a puzzle where you need to find and use several specific pieces to see the full picture. The researchers, Yixuan Tang and Yi Yang from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, realized that most current systems aren't very good at answering these multi-step questions because they either don’t find the right info or they don't put it together well. So, they made a new dataset specifically for these types of questions. They hope that their work will help improve these smart systems, making them more reliable and perhaps even reduce instances where these systems just make up answers (hallucinate). They used a collection of news articles to test their ideas and checked how well various smart systems could answer these multi-step questions. Unfortunately, they found out that the systems still struggle quite a bit. Even when given the correct pieces of info, these systems often couldn’t combine them to give the right answer. In a nutshell, this paper is trying to make AI systems better at answering complex, multi-step questions by providing a new tool for checking how good these systems are at retrieving and piecing together multiple bits of information. It's like assessing the detective skills of a computer but with a focus on complex problems that require considering many clues."},{"instruction":"what are the limitations of this study?","output":"The research paper you've provided describes some limitations of the study towards the end. Here are the limitations expressed in layperson's terms: 1. **Simple Answers**: The dataset they created only allows for very straightforward answers like 'yes', 'no', or a specific name or time word. This means that the smart systems aren’t tested on giving longer or more complex answers. In real life, you might want more detailed responses. 2. **Limited Evidence**: The questions in the study only require up to four pieces of evidence to answer. But some real-world questions might need information from more than four sources. The study doesn’t look at how well computer systems can handle those bigger puzzles. 3. **Basic Testing Framework**: The study used a traditional way to test how well the computer systems can retrieve and piece together information (known as the RAG framework), but there are more advanced methods out there that might test the systems in different ways. In short, the study points out that it hasn't tapped into the full range of capabilities that smart systems might need to answer real complex questions because it used simple criteria for answers, didn't require a great deal of evidence, and stuck to traditional testing methods. It suggests that future research could explore these areas further."},{"instruction":"The study states that the experiments use a basic RAG framework with LlamaIndex. And that future work could involve evaluating multi-hop queries using more advanced RAG frameworks or LLM-agent frameworks. What are the benefits of using LLM-agent frameworks? What about function calling?","output":"An **LLM-agent framework** refers to a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with agent-based capabilities. Agent-based systems are designed to act with a certain level of autonomy, performing sequences of actions to achieve specific goals. When you combine these with LLMs, they can potentially offer several benefits: 1. **Better Context Management**: Agents can keep track of a conversation over a longer period and manage context better. This is helpful for multi-hop queries, where an answer might depend on a chain of information. 2. **Sequential Decision Making**: LLM-agents can more effectively plan and execute a series of steps, which is useful for multi-hop queries that require multiple pieces of information or reasoning steps. 3. **Autonomy and Initiative**: Agents can take initiative, potentially asking clarifying questions or seeking additional information if what they have isn't enough to answer a question fully. This can improve the quality and precision of the answers provided. 4. **Interactive Learning**: By interacting with the environment and users, LLM-agents can learn and adapt over time, improving their ability to retrieve and synthesize information based on feedback. Regarding **function calling**, this is a more technical aspect of how LLMs and agents can be used. In a computational context, a function is a piece of code that performs a specific task. **Function calling** means instructing the computer to execute that piece of code. In the realm of LLMs and agents, function calling may refer to: 1. **Interfacing with External APIs or Databases**: LLM-agents could call functions to retrieve real-time data from a database or online source, rather than relying solely on pre-existing knowledge. 2. **Automated Task Execution**: Functions can be called to perform automated tasks based on the information processed by the LLM-agent, such as sending emails, setting reminders, searching the internet, or translating text. 3. **Complex Data Processing**: Some questions require analysis of complex data that an LLM alone isn't equipped to handle. Function calls could enable the LLM-agent to use specialized algorithms or processing tools to analyze this data. 4. **Customization and Extension**: Developers can use function calls to customize or extend the capabilities of an LLM-agent, adding new features or integrating with other services, depending on the user's needs. In essence, leveraging LLM-agent frameworks and function calling is akin to giving a digital personal assistant not just the knowledge to answer your questions but the ability to actually perform tasks, learn from interactions, and harness various tools and services to better assist you. It's upgrading from having a static encyclopedia to a proactive, learning, digital helper."},{"instruction":"\\"Complex Data Processing: Some questions require analysis of complex data that an LLM alone isn’t equipped to handle. Function calls could enable the LLM-agent to use specialized algorithms or processing tools to analyze this data.\\" According to this, can llm agents use function calling to process vast amounts of unstructured data effectively?","output":"LLM agents can leverage function calling to utilize specialized algorithms designed to process vast amounts of unstructured data. While LLMs are inherently skilled at understanding and generating human language, they may not be as adept at tasks that require structured data processing or executing complex algorithms outside the scope of their training. Here's how function calling can enhance an LLM agent's capabilities to handle unstructured data: 1. **Data Parsing and Structuring**: By calling functions that parse and convert unstructured data into a structured format, LLM agents can make this data more accessible for analysis. For instance, converting raw text into a tabular format that highlights key entities and their relationships. 2. **Integration with Processing Tools**: LLM agents can call external processing tools, such as natural language processing (NLP) libraries or data analysis software, to handle specific tasks better suited for these tools, like sentiment analysis or topic modeling. 3. **Algorithmic Processing**: Some data processing requires sophisticated algorithms, such as clustering or pattern recognition. An LLM agent can call functions that execute these algorithms to derive insights from unstructured data. 4. **Augmenting Decisions with External Inputs**: By processing real-time data feeds or querying databases through function calls, LLM agents can complement their language-based insights with actual, up-to-date data, which is crucial for informed decision-making. It is important to note that the effectiveness of LLM agents in processing unstructured data via function calls largely depends on the specific functions being called, their integration into the LLM agent's workflow, and the ability of the system to interpret the results of these functions in a meaningful way. Moreover, the quality and accessibility of the unstructured data and the robustness of the underlying LLM training also play a significant role. In summary, while LLM agents are not natively designed to process large volumes of unstructured data, with the help of function calling, they can tap into specialized resources and algorithms to extend their capabilities significantly. This allows them to sift through and make sense of complex data sets they would not be able to handle on their own."},{"instruction":"let's continue with another article. Explain the following like i am a layperson: \\"\\" Agentic RAG With LlamaIndex The topic of Agentic RAG explores how agents can be incorporated into existing RAG pipelines for enhanced, conversational search and retrieval. Cobus Greyling LlamaIndex Blog Cobus Greyling Introduction Considering the architecture below, it is evident how Agentic RAG creates an implementation which easily scales. New documents can be added with each new set being managed by a sub-agent. The basic structure of LlamaIndex’s approach called Agentic RAG is shown in the diagram below where a large set of documents are ingested, in this case it was limited to 100. The large corpus of data is broken up into smaller documents. An agent is created for each document, and each of the numerous document agents have the power of search via embeddings and to summarise the response. A top-level agent is created over the set of document agents. The meta-agent / top-level agent performs tool retrieval and then uses Chain-of-Thought to answer the user’s question. The Rerank endpoint computes a relevance score for the query and each document, and returns a sorted list from the most to the least relevant document. Notebook Example Here you will find a Colab notebook with a fully working and executed example of this implementation. To run the notebook, you will need an OpenAI and Cohere API key… import os import openai import cohere os.environ[\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\"] = \\"Your API Key goes here\\" os.environ[\\"COHERE_API_KEY\\"] = \\"Your API Key goes here\\" For each document agent, the system prompt is: You are a specialized agent designed to answer queries about the \`{file_base}.html\` part of the LlamaIndex docs. You must ALWAYS use at least one of the tools provided when answering a question; do NOT rely on prior knowledge. The system prompt for the meta-agent /top-agent: You are an agent designed to answer queries about the documentation. Please always use the tools provided to answer a question. Do not rely on prior knowledge Working Example I asked the agent the following question: Tell me about LlamaIndex connectors Below is the detailed answer generated by the agent: Thought: I need to use a tool to help me answer the question. Action: tool_latest_search Action Input: {‘input’: ‘LlamaIndex connectors’} Added user message to memory: LlamaIndex connectors === Calling Function === Calling function: vector_tool_latest_search with args: { “input”: “LlamaIndex connectors” } Got output: The LlamaIndex connectors can be found on the /content/docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/search.html page. ======================== Observation: The LlamaIndex connectors are not specifically mentioned in the \`latest_search.html\` part of the LlamaIndex docs. You may need to check other sections of the documentation for detailed information about LlamaIndex connectors. Thought: I need to search for information about LlamaIndex connectors in a different tool. Action: tool_latest_index Action Input: {‘input’: ‘LlamaIndex connectors’} Added user message to memory: LlamaIndex connectors === Calling Function === Calling function: vector_tool_latest_index with args: { “input”: “LlamaIndex connectors” } Got output: LlamaIndex provides data connectors that allow you to ingest your existing data from various sources and formats. These connectors can work with APIs, PDFs, SQL, and more. By using LlamaIndex connectors, you can easily bring your data into the LlamaIndex ecosystem and make it accessible for natural language access and retrieval. ======================== Observation: LlamaIndex offers data connectors that enable you to import your existing data from a variety of sources and formats. These connectors are compatible with APIs, PDFs, SQL, and more. Utilizing LlamaIndex connectors allows you to seamlessly integrate your data into the LlamaIndex ecosystem, making it readily available for natural language access and retrieval. Thought: I can answer without using any more tools. Answer: LlamaIndex connectors are used to import existing data from various sources and formats into the LlamaIndex ecosystem. These connectors are compatible with APIs, PDFs, SQL, and more, allowing seamless integration of data for natural language access and retrieval. Below is a snipped from the Colab notebook: Source This complex implementation from LlamaIndex is an example of multi-document agents which can: Select documents relevant to a user query Execute an agentic loop over the documents relevant to the query; including chain-of-thought, summarisation and reranking. In Conclusion This implementation by LlamaIndex illustrates a few key principles… Agentic RAG, where an agent approach is followed for a RAG implementation adds resilience and intelligence to the RAG implementation. It is a good illustration of multi-agent orchestration. This architecture serves as a good reference framework of how scaling an agent can be optimised with a second tier of smaller worker-agents. Agentic RAG is an example of a controlled and well defined autonomous agent implementation. One of the most sought-after enterprise LLM implementation types are RAG, Agentic RAG is a natural progression of this. It is easy to envisage how this architecture can grow and expand over an organisation with more sub bots being added. ⭐️ Follow me on LinkedIn for updates on Large Language Models ⭐️\\"\\"","output":"Imagine you’re trying to assemble a huge jigsaw puzzle with pieces spread all over the place. Now, think of \\"Agentic RAG With LlamaIndex\\" as an approach meant to help you manage that task more efficiently. Here's how you can think of it: **Agentic RAG**: This is like a team of helpers, each specializing in finding certain pieces of the jigsaw puzzle (in this case, pieces of information from a huge collection of documents). These helpers are called 'agents'. **LlamaIndex**: You can think of LlamaIndex as the organizer who knows how to break down the big puzzle into smaller sections so each agent can work more effectively. Here’s what the article is mainly saying: 1. **Agents Working on Smaller Pieces**: Instead of trying to look for puzzle pieces across the entire pile, each agent focuses on a smaller section. That way, they can find the needed pieces quicker because they're only searching through a small part. 2. **Top-level Agent Overseeing Everything**: Imagine there’s a chief helper who knows what all the other helpers are doing. This chief helper can guide them to the right sections and help them connect their individual pieces correctly. 3. **Using the Right Tools**: These agents use special tools to find the puzzle pieces. These tools can be things like keywords or summaries to help pinpoint the right info. 4. **Reranking for Relevance**: After the helpers find some potential pieces, they line them up so that the most likely useful pieces are first. It’s like if you were looking for sky pieces in a puzzle, your helper would bring you all the blue pieces they found. The author, Cobus Greyling, describes how you can actually try out this approach using a \\"Colab notebook\\". This is a place online where you can see how the agents find puzzle pieces (information). But to do this, you need special access keys — think of these as the entry pass to use these smart helpers. For a working example, the author asks about a part of LlamaIndex called 'connectors'. The agents go look through various document sections and come back with what they found, connecting the dots to answer the author's question. In conclusion, the article talks about how this smart method of finding and connecting information can grow and improve how businesses use large language models, like a puzzle-solving assembly line getting faster and smarter. It suggests that this kind of system, with all its helpful agents, could be very good for companies that want to manage a lot of information efficiently. And just like adding more helpers for a big puzzle, you can add more agents as the company's information or 'puzzle' grows."},{"instruction":"how is this 'Agentic Rag' method different from agents using function calling? Or is it the same concept?","output":"The \\"Agentic RAG\\" method and agents using function calling are related but not identical. They both involve using advanced capabilities for processing information, but they serve different functions within the realm of computational tasks and artificial intelligence (AI). Let’s break it down: **Agentic RAG Method**: - **Agentic RAG** (\\"RAG\\" stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is about dividing a large search task among many specialized agents, each responsible for a subset of the data. These agents are like expert researchers who only focus on a particular area. - Each agent retrieves or generates information from their assigned area, using methods that might include function calls, to answer complex, multi-part questions. - There’s a top-level agent (like a project manager) overseeing all these smaller agents, coordinating the process, and putting together a coherent response. **Agents Using Function Calling**: - **Function calling** is a basic operation in computer programming where a program invokes or runs a set of instructions to perform a specific task. This can be part of any type of system, not just agents. - In an AI system, agents can use function calls to perform specific tasks, like looking up information, running a calculation, or altering a database entry. Here, function calls are like telling a digital assistant exactly what task to perform. - Function calling doesn’t necessarily imply the same structure or system of division, collaboration, and hierarchy that you find in Agentic RAG. It’s a tool that can be used within an Agentic RAG system, or by any other kind of agent or program for a wide variety of tasks. To summarize in a non-technical way: Imagine a large theater production with many actors, each responsible for their own role. This is akin to Agentic RAG, where every agent is an actor specializing in a certain part of the performance. Function calling, on the other hand, is like an actor on stage pulling a lever to make something specific happen, like dimming the lights or starting background music. The lever-pulling is just one action they can perform and not the full scope of their role in the production. In essence, while Agentic RAG is a structured method for agents dividing and conquering retrieval tasks, function calling is a specific operation that an agent can perform. Agentic RAG systems can use function calls as one of their tools, but they also orchestrate interactions between different agents for complex data retrieval and processing."},{"instruction":"How is Agentic Rag similar or different from the toolkit listed below (Phidata)?

But instead of fixing leaky faucets or broken doors, Phidata helps you build AI Assistants—think of them like virtual helpers, kind of like Siri or Alexa. Here's how Phidata compares to Agentic RAG: **Similarities**: - Both involve **\\"function calling\\"**. This is like the assistant being able to do a variety of specific tasks. If you asked your virtual helper to turn the lights on, turning on the lights would be the \\"function\\" it's calling. - They aim to make AI smarter and capable of doing more complex jobs by breaking big tasks into smaller, more manageable ones, then working on those sub-tasks intelligently. **Differences**: 1. **Structure and Focus**: - **Agentic RAG** has a focus on searching through documents to find and put together information—the puzzle analogy I used earlier. - **Phidata** is about giving your AI Assistant a set of tools to do all sorts of tasks, not just looking up information but potentially interacting with databases, summarizing PDFs, or pulling data from websites. 2. **How They Are Used**: - **Agentic RAG** is more about **scale and collaboration** among agents, where lots of little helper agents are managed by one big agent to tackle massive information-processing jobs. - **Phidata** is like a **DIY kit for AI**. It gives you everything you need so you can put together your own AI helper, adding specific \\"tools\\" (or functions) depending on what you want your assistant to do, like summarizing articles or finding the latest news. 3. **Building Applications**: - While **Agentic RAG** seems to be about enhancing an AI's ability within a complex framework, it doesn't explicitly say it's user-friendly or suitable for someone without a tech background. - **Phidata**, on the other hand, sells itself as easy-to-use (they mention you can get it up and running with just a few commands) and versatile, so even if you're not super tech-savvy, you can still build something cool with it. 4. **Deployment**: - **Agentic RAG** might be more about large-scale search and information operations within big systems. - **Phidata** shows you how to serve your AI assistant online or even connect it to AWS (which is like putting your AI helper in the cloud so it can help users anywhere on the internet), and how to improve and tailor it to particular products. In conclusion, Agentic RAG specializes in handling and understanding complex, multilayered questions in a dynamic, large-scale context. Phidata provides a broader toolkit that allows for more varied tasks and might be easier to set up for a wide array of AI applications, such as building web apps or connecting to various data sources. Both have the end goal of creating smart, reliable AI systems, but they're like different toolkits with different strengths, depending on what you need your virtual assistant to do."},{"instruction":"if i am working with mostly unstructured data that is pulled or scraped from different platforms, which toolkit would be the most effective for me to work with?","output":"When dealing with mostly unstructured data pulled or scraped from various platforms, the choice between Agentic RAG and a toolkit like Phidata would hinge on the specifics of your tasks and what you aim to achieve with the AI assistant. **If your primary task is to search through the data, organize it, and then generate answers or insights**, Agentic RAG would be a fitting choice. It’s designed to handle large volumes of data (like your diverse, unstructured data), and its use of sub-agents to manage different data subsets could be particularly effective. Imagine having a team where each member becomes an expert in understanding and retrieving information from a specific data type or platform. **On the other hand, if you need an AI assistant that not only searches and retrieves information but also performs a variety of other functions**, Phidata might be a better option. With Phidata, you can arm your AI with a range of tools (functions) that do more than just search—they could summarize content, interact with databases, or even analyze and respond to data from the web. It's kind of like having a Swiss Army knife for data—it has a tool for many different tasks you might encounter. Let’s put this in a more concrete scenario: - **Using Agentic RAG**: This would be like having a large research team where everyone focuses on a specific subject area. When you ask a complex question that touches on several topics, each team member chips in with their expertise, and the team leader compiles their inputs into a coherent answer. - **Using Phidata**: This would be akin to a single researcher who has a computer program to help them. They have different software tools they can call on for specific needs—like one tool for web searches, another for reading PDFs, and another for sorting through database entries. Ultimately, if your main priority is just to organize and understand the unstructured data you’ve collected, go for Agentic RAG. But if you’re looking for more flexibility and the ability to add a wide variety of “skills” to your AI’s repertoire that can use data in multiple ways, Phidata might be the better toolkit for your needs."},{"instruction":"Perhaps we could combine both tools? Let's brainstorm different examples. Keep in mind, i'm mainly interested in using use these tools for Quantitative Financial analysis of unstructured datasets.","output":"Certainly! Combining the strengths of both Agentic RAG and Phidata could lead to a powerful synergy for tackling quantitative financial analysis in unstructured datasets. Let's brainstorm how we might use each system's capabilities for this purpose: 1. **Data Retrieval and Organization**: - Use **Agentic RAG** to scour financial reports, news articles, social media feeds, and market analysis blogs to find relevant pieces of financial information. - Each agent can specialize in a particular type of financial data, such as one for market trends, another for earnings reports, another for regulatory changes, etc. 2. **Function Execution for Specific Analyses**: - **Phidata** can bring in tools that perform specialized calculations, like computing financial ratios, volatility measures, or risk assessments using the retrieved information. - Create functions that can process natural language to extract financial figures and indicators from unstructured text. 3. **Real-time Data Processing**: - Implement Phidata functions that interface with real-time market data APIs to augment the historical or contextual data that Agentic RAG agents retrieve. - Develop a tool that instantly evaluates news sentiment or social media buzz on certain stocks or cryptocurrencies and understands its potential impact on market movements. 4. **Integrating Predictive Analytics**: - Use **Phidata** to integrate machine learning models that predict stock performance based on patterns found in historical data trends collected by Agentic RAG agents. - Set up functions to perform Monte Carlo simulations or other stochastic models to forecast financial scenarios. 5. **Automated Reporting and Summarization**: - Design a Phidata tool to summarize lengthy financial reports into digestible insights, which could then be reviewed by a top-level agent from the Agentic RAG system to provide an overall market outlook. - Create a function that generates automated updates on portfolio performance, including insights into market changes and investment opportunities. 6. **Creating a Responsive AI Analyst**: - Combine the orchestration capabilities of **Agentic RAG** with the versatile function-calling of Phidata to create an AI financial analyst that can answer complex quantitative inquiries, update financial models with the latest data, and perform ad-hoc analyses as requested by human analysts. 7. **Scalable Financial Dashboards**: - Leverage Agentic RAG to continually update a knowledge base with the latest financial data and news. - Use Phidata to build interactive dashboards that can run various financial analyses on demand and provide visualizations and insights into market conditions. By integrating Agentic RAG's document-retrieval capabilities with Phidata's flexible toolkit of functions, you can construct an AI-driven system capable of sifting through vast amounts of unstructured financial data to offer comprehensive, quantitative analysis. This integrated system would essentially act as a highly sophisticated, data-driven assistant to financial analysts, providing both the depth and breadth of analysis necessary to inform investment decisions."},{"instruction":"Could Phidata interact with a web scraping API that pulls unstructured data from different platforms? Perhaps then it could process the data in way that reveals insights into a publicly listed company.","output":"Yes, Phidata can indeed interact with a web scraping API to pull unstructured data from various platforms. Given its toolkit nature and emphasis on function calling, Phidata is designed to integrate with a variety of tools, including those for web scraping. Let's flesh out a potential workflow that would allow Phidata to process data in a way that reveals insights into a publicly listed company: **Step 1: Web Scraping** - Integrate Phidata with a web scraping API such as Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, or a commercial web scraping service. Set up the function calls so that Phidata can automate the process of pulling financial news, company regulatory filings, social media sentiment, and other relevant data from targeted web platforms. **Step 2: Data Cleaning and Structuring** - Once the data is collected, use Phidata’s tools to clean and organize the raw data. This might involve removing irrelevant content, correcting formatting issues, and tagging key pieces of information such as company names, financial figures, dates, etc. **Step 3: Data Analysis** - Implement custom Phidata functions that analyze the structured data to extract financial indicators, like price-to-earnings ratios, debt levels, or revenue growth. These custom functions might utilize Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical analysis. **Step 4: Pattern Detection and Insights Generation** - Create functions within Phidata to identify patterns or trends in the data, such as unusual stock price movements following certain types of news releases, or shifts in market sentiment preceding changes in financial performance. - Use natural language processing (NLP) tools to assess the context and significance of the information, determining how they relate to the overall insight you want to gather about the company. **Step 5: Reporting and Visualization** - Develop functions that present the data analysis results in an easy-to-understand format. This could be a written report summarizing the key findings or interactive visualizations that highlight market trends and company performance metrics. - Phidata could then serve these insights through user-friendly interfaces like Streamlit, FastAPI, or Django, as mentioned in the toolkit description. **Step 6: Integration and Feedback** - Set up Phidata to receive feedback from users, which could be financial analysts or investors, on the usefulness and accuracy of the insights provided. Use this feedback to refine and improve the functions and models within the toolkit. By integrating Phidata with a web scraping API and leveraging its function-calling abilities to process and analyze the unstructured data, you can create a powerful analytical tool that reveals actionable insights into publicly listed companies. The insights generated can inform investment strategies, market research, and due diligence processes."},{"instruction":"In 'Step 5: Reporting and Visualization' we could potentially use 'Agentic Rag' to ingest the large corpus of data generated by Phidata's functions and break it up into smaller documents. An agent will then be created for each document, and each of the numerous document agents have the power of search via embeddings and to summarise the response.","output":"Absolutely, your understanding is spot on. Let's elaborate on that step with both toolkits in mind: **Combining Phidata and Agentic RAG for Reporting and Visualization**: 1. **Initial Data Processing by Phidata**: - Phidata's custom functions have already processed the unstructured data from various platforms and used web scraping APIs to extract relevant financial information, perform statistical analyses, and identify key insights regarding the publicly listed company. 2. **Data Ingestion and Segmentation with Agentic RAG**: - At this juncture, Agentic RAG takes over by ingesting the large corpus of processed data from Phidata. It divides this information into smaller, more manageable documents or sections. Each segment could represent a different aspect of the financial analysis, such as market trends, financial ratios, competitive analysis, or investor sentiment. 3. **Creation of Specialized Document Agents**: - For each segmented document, a specialized agent is created. These document agents are endowed with the power to further search and refine the information using embeddings—a technique that captures the essence of the data in a form that's easier for machines to understand and compare. 4. **Summarization and Synthesis**: - Each agent applies its summarization abilities to condense the document into key takeaways and executive summaries. This helps distill the complex analyses into digestible insights that can be quickly grasped by decision-makers. 5. **Meta-Agent Coordination**: - A top-level meta-agent or orchestrator reviews the summaries and insights provided by the document agents. It ensures the overall coherence, eliminates any redundancies, and weaves the various parts into a comprehensive narrative that provides a 360-degree view of the listed company based on the initial data. 6. **Final Reporting**: - The synthesized report is then visualized, perhaps using Phidata functions or other visualization tools, to create dashboards or presentations that convey the insights in an interactive and engaging manner. 7. **Ongoing Updates and Learning**: - As new data comes in, or as analysts interact with the system (inputting queries, requesting clarifications, or providing feedback), the agents adapt and learn. They refine their processing and summarization to better serve the users' needs over time. By integrating Agentic RAG's document management and summarization capabilities with Phidata's initial data processing and analysis, you create a dynamic system that not only extracts and processes massive amounts of unstructured data but also effectively communicates complex insights to financial analysts and decision-makers. Such a system could be incredibly valuable for gaining a competitive edge in financial analysis and market intelligence."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (When I first arrived in the town of Drakenburg, I noticed that some of the locals - some with features of real-life creatures, while others with features of fictional creatures - were shocked by my sudden appearance.

Программное добавление URL в список разрешенных не возможно из-за ограничений безопасности платформы MetaTrader. Пользователь должен вручную добавить URL в настройках MetaTrader. Однако советник может предоставить пользователю сообщение о необходимости добавления URL. Вот шаги, которые пользователь должен выполнить для добавления URL: 1. Открыть MetaTrader 5. 2. Перейти в меню \\"Сервис\\" ➜ \\"Настройки\\" или нажать \`Ctrl+O\`. 3. Перейти на вкладку \\"Эксперты\\". 4. В разделе \\"Допустить WebRequest для следующих URL:\\" добавить необходимый URL. 5. Нажать \\"OK\\" для сохранения изменений. Для создания уведомления внутри советника, которое напоминает пользователю добавить URL, можно использовать следующий код в функции OnInit() или в других частях кода, где требуется WebRequest: \`\`\`mql5 int OnInit() { // Ваш код инициализации if(!WebRequestAllowed()) { Print(\\"Добавьте необходимый URL в разрешенные в настройках MetaTrader: https://example.com/api\\"); } // Остальная часть кода инициализации return(INIT_SUCCEEDED); } bool WebRequestAllowed() { string testUrl = \\"https://example.com/api\\"; char post[]; char result[]; char headers[]; int timeout = 5000; int res = WebRequest(\\"GET\\", testUrl, headers, 0, post, result, headers, timeout); return (res == 200); // Если возвращается код 200, значит, URL разрешен } \`\`\` В этом примере функция \`WebRequestAllowed()\` пытается совершить запрос на указанный URL. Если запрос не удается, советник выводит сообщение, которое пользователь увидит в журнале терминала. Это напомнит пользователю о необходимости добавления URL в список разрешенных. Обратите внимание, что проверка URL при помощи \`WebRequest()\` не может служить абсолютным методом определения, разрешен ли URL, так как неудачный запрос может произойти по другим причинам, например, из-за сетевых ограничений или ошибок на сервере. Тем не менее, вы не можете программно изменить настройки MetaTrader для добавления URL из-за вопросов безопасности. Это требует ручного вмешательства пользователя."},{"instruction":"как сделать так что бы советник пересылал данные мне в телеграм","output":"Для того чтобы советник MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) отправлял данные в Telegram, можно использовать Telegram Bot API. В этом процессе участвуют следующие этапы: 1. Создание Telegram бота через BotFather. 2. Получение токена доступа для вашего бота. 3. Настройка советника для отправки сообщений через бота. # Создание Telegram бота 1. В Telegram найдите пользователя с именем @BotFather. 2. Начните чат с BotFather и выполните команду \`/newbot\`. 3. Следуйте инструкциям BotFather для создания нового бота. 4. После успешного создания бота BotFather предоставит вам токен для доступа к API Telegram. # Получение ID чата 1. Добавьте созданного бота в группу или начните с ним личный чат. 2. Отправьте боту любое сообщение. 3. Выполните запрос к API Telegram для получения обновлений и идентификатора чата. Пример URL запроса (необходимо заменить \`YOUR_BOT_TOKEN\` на полученный токен бота): \`\`\` https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates \`\`\` Ищите в полученном ответе поле \`\\"chat\\"\` и его идентификатор \`\\"id\\"\`. # Настройка MetaTrader 5 1.

and ways of using the data. 0:0:9.550 --> 0:0:18.230 Will Lytle So I think it's we're going through this today, it would be very good if this is a kind of collaborative effort, collaborative conversation. 0:0:18.240 --> 0:0:21.380 Will Lytle So if you do have any questions, please raise your hand. 0:0:22.990 --> 0:0:31.60 Will Lytle Also, if there's any potential use cases that you have or challenges that you have, those always gonna be far more interesting because we can actually use your data. 0:0:31.70 --> 0:0:38.120 Will Lytle Sometimes it's very difficult for me to illustrate a use case when the data doesn't necessarily marry up to that use case. 0:0:38.470 --> 0:0:40.740 Will Lytle So they'll have to be a little bit of suspension of disbelief. 0:0:40.750 --> 0:0:53.630 Will Lytle I guess today was we go through some of this because obviously we'll be looking at your data and I can't always curate the problem that I'm necessarily trying to to evidence as a potential use case for Plandek or the data behind you know what might lead to these decisions. 0:0:53.640 --> 0:1:4.250 Will Lytle So if there are any like real life examples that will just make the conversation today, I think a little bit more, more relevant or at least have some evidence backed data for us to be able to take a look at. 0:1:4.970 --> 0:1:7.780 Will Lytle I'm feel free to use the chat as well. 0:1:7.930 --> 0:1:14.200 Will Lytle I'll try to keep an eye on the chat as quickly as closely as I can throughout this and we will. 0:1:14.510 --> 0:1:16.560 Will Lytle We'll pick up any of those questions as we go along. 0:1:16.810 --> 0:1:17.490 Will Lytle So that sounds good. 0:1:19.360 --> 0:1:19.800 Speaker 1 Yep. 0:1:19.980 --> 0:1:24.590 Speaker 1 Yeah, I will monitor it to chat as well and and inform you as any question. 0:1:25.960 --> 0:1:27.690 Will Lytle Alright, OK. 0:1:27.700 --> 0:1:44.430 Will Lytle So, umm, inevitably I'm going to have to pick a space, so we're going to pick the emergent PR space, so apologies in advance if this is your space and and and we're gonna use your data today as a Guinea pig. 0:1:46.470 --> 0:1:58.60 Will Lytle What I wanted to do is pick, I think a couple of the real common metrics that we see a lot of across a lot of our clients and just talk through some of the different ways in which people are looking at this data, how they're using this data. 0:1:58.70 --> 0:2:5.960 Will Lytle Some of the insights that might pop up into this data that might be relevant to you, it might not be, but please, you know, feel free to ask along the way. 0:2:7.30 --> 0:2:23.470 Will Lytle I wanted to start with print Sprint predictability because I think from a, you know from a getting started perspective, this is probably one of the metrics which I think has you know it's easiest to to understand what's going on here. 0:2:23.480 --> 0:2:28.350 Will Lytle And it's also, I think, relevant and useful for the majority of teams, at least those teams. 0:2:28.360 --> 0:2:29.670 Will Lytle Obviously they're doing Scrum. 0:2:29.680 --> 0:2:31.90 Will Lytle If you're a Cadman team, we will. 0:2:31.180 --> 0:2:51.370 Will Lytle We will talk a little bit about Kanban metrics today, but we'll start with Scrum just because the largest proportion of teams are so Sprint predictability is, you know, at the end of the day it's about driving a very simple behavior, which is the ability for a team to consistently plan and execute right plan. 0:2:51.380 --> 0:2:57.570 Will Lytle Meaning we understand what our capacity is, what our potential velocity is, right? 0:2:57.640 --> 0:3:0.210 Will Lytle We can effectively plan against that, right? 0:3:0.220 --> 0:3:8.820 Will Lytle We can identify what are the goals we want to achieve this Sprint and therefore what are the tickets that we need to put into this Sprint to be successful in accomplishing that. 0:3:10.300 --> 0:3:17.500 Will Lytle The emergent team here is is, you know, fairly successful, I would say in this point with a lot of clients. 0:3:17.770 --> 0:3:28.410 Will Lytle We always suggest that teams are aiming between 80 to 90% AH and you don't want to really be much less much. 0:3:28.980 --> 0:3:37.750 Will Lytle You know further below 80% because ultimately that then statistically starts to impact the ability for the team to plan on what to execute on what they planned on. 0:3:37.800 --> 0:3:49.590 Will Lytle So if you're working in a a quarterly road map and that quarter is based on a series of, let's say fate sprints or whatever, it might be 6 sprints. 0:3:51.140 --> 0:3:54.890 Will Lytle You wanna make sure that each one of those sprints are orchestrated correctly? 0:3:55.920 --> 0:4:13.810 Will Lytle If you wanna be able to kind of make it to the end of that that quarter having achieve most most of what you have counted what you said out to accomplish and I say most because I don't think agile and necessarily is best applied when trying to deliver a full scope of 100% of things over 1/4. 0:4:13.880 --> 0:4:30.470 Will Lytle They're probably different methods that you could use that will be a little bit more effective at delivering a fixed scope or for a fixed time I waterfall, but when you are looking to be able to delivered to a target with a little food ability, it's quite an effective way of doing that. 0:4:30.620 --> 0:4:46.240 Will Lytle Now obviously, if you go above 90% then the question is ultimately in the if we're able to achieve 95 to 100% of what we planned every Sprint and we're dealing with some level of acceptance scope change, cause priorities will change. 0:4:46.250 --> 0:4:53.140 Will Lytle There will be things that get reprioritized because they must be reprioritized, there might be a production incident that pops up that needs to be dealt with. 0:4:55.80 --> 0:5:3.570 Will Lytle You really don't wanna be accomplishing 100% and also accounting for those things because then it probably suggests that you're really under planning based on your capacity. 0:5:3.580 --> 0:5:11.150 Will Lytle So you wanna set you wanna set the goal of the team is to accomplish a number of goals and a number of tickets that really deliver those goals. 0:5:11.500 --> 0:5:17.370 Will Lytle But be realistic about the fact that because of the process we're taking, 100% isn't actually the right goal post. 0:5:17.380 --> 0:5:19.220 Will Lytle It should probably be somewhere between 8:00 and 90%. 0:5:20.800 --> 0:5:22.510 Will Lytle So why does this metric matter? 0:5:22.980 --> 0:5:23.590 Will Lytle OK. 0:5:23.900 --> 0:5:32.720 Will Lytle Well, number one is in the top left age, your velocity and you can toggle between whether you want to measure the velocity with story points or tickets. 0:5:34.910 --> 0:5:36.710 Will Lytle That should be a very simple option here. 0:5:36.780 --> 0:5:38.810 Will Lytle How you want this to be to be calculated? 0:5:39.160 --> 0:5:49.390 Will Lytle The reason I put tickets and I think the reason why I tickets is most meaningful for most teams, is most teams don't story point things like a subtask or they don't. 0:5:49.400 --> 0:6:2.90 Will Lytle Sorry, point their bugs or defects or support tickets or you know a lot of teams focus on story pointing things like stories or potentially bugs that are in a backlog that are not related directly to the story. 0:6:2.100 --> 0:6:4.610 Will Lytle So what you guys call a story bug in this instance, right? 0:6:6.580 --> 0:6:18.110 Will Lytle And so if you use story points as the calculation for this, mathematically you will not be calculating the things that aren't story point, and you'll only be your numerator and your denominator is basically based on story points. 0:6:18.300 --> 0:6:28.30 Will Lytle And so whilst it's a meaningful view, if you're really wanting to focus on what proportion of the kind of new value that we're delivering in terms of story points is being put, then that's fine. 0:6:28.250 --> 0:6:33.690 Will Lytle But if you're trying to get a full picture, then I think the tickets provide a more representative view now. 0:6:35.590 --> 0:6:45.940 Will Lytle I think more important than the velocity is really the volatility because what this volatility does is it basically manages or looks at the standard deviation for your team. 0:6:46.70 --> 0:6:48.660 Will Lytle So you can actually show what are the sprints. 0:6:48.670 --> 0:6:54.180 Will Lytle We're taking a look at what is the simple standard deviation of that and how that's calculated right. 0:6:54.220 --> 0:7:2.700 Will Lytle So you can see the volatility calculation here to give you a little bit of an understanding of what the hell is 52 meters, what is 53 mean and what is 53 mean here. 0:7:2.850 --> 0:7:15.300 Will Lytle So this is showing you that currently based on the last five sprints, the volatility of 52, if we look to the last Sprint based on the five sprints prior to that, right, it would be 53 and 53. 0:7:15.310 --> 0:7:17.980 Will Lytle So you can see that there is a trend here, right? 0:7:18.20 --> 0:7:23.60 Will Lytle And the reason this is so important is because you're velocity is one thing, right? 0:7:23.70 --> 0:7:41.930 Will Lytle But if you're calling trying to use your velocity to get some sort of an understanding in a future view of you know, how much can we deliver over the next 5 sprints for Pi, the volatility is gonna be quite important because it adds a low level of confidence behind whether or not 8 tickets is something credible or whether or not that's going to be highly variant. 0:7:41.990 --> 0:7:51.920 Will Lytle Now, this one in particular here is impacted quite significantly by this Sprint, which will go into in a second, cause there's something that happened in this Sprint which I think is important. 0:7:54.290 --> 0:8:4.980 Will Lytle But otherwise, I would argue that between eight, 11810 and 11, there actually is a reasonable volatility there. 0:8:5.250 --> 0:8:12.920 Will Lytle OK, now this calculation here at the moment is based on what was included the start of the Sprint. 0:8:13.340 --> 0:8:13.710 Will Lytle OK. 0:8:13.720 --> 0:8:19.410 Will Lytle So when we say velocity it's I want the velocity, the things that we did we completed before the end of the Sprint. 0:8:19.460 --> 0:8:26.410 Will Lytle I want that to be based on only the tickets that were planned before the Sprint started, right in terms of commitment. 0:8:26.420 --> 0:8:32.80 Will Lytle What we said we were going to do, I want that to equally be based on only the tickets that were included. 0:8:32.90 --> 0:8:33.210 Will Lytle The start of the Sprint. 0:8:33.840 --> 0:8:55.350 Will Lytle The reason this is often used as a default, and again I think there's a there's value in looking at it both ways is ultimately what you're trying to drive long term is at a level of maturity that we can plan and execute before we hit start in the Sprint right that we with a high level of confidence we can identify what our goals are for this Sprint. 0:8:55.400 --> 0:9:2.40 Will Lytle We can identify the tickets that we need to deliver to deliver those goals, and therefore this is a good starting point for us to be able to measure it. 0:9:2.600 --> 0:9:14.330 Will Lytle That said, if you are a team that's equally dealing with things coming in and out of the Sprint, you could also bubble this to look at anything that was ever included in the Sprint. 0:9:14.340 --> 0:9:22.870 Will Lytle So whether something was added to the Sprint or was planned at the start of the Sprint right, you can now have the calculation based on that. 0:9:22.980 --> 0:9:30.110 Will Lytle Now you still see a little bit of an impact here and I I can't tell you the context about what happened here and I don't think it's important for today's conversation. 0:9:30.940 --> 0:9:31.820 Will Lytle Obviously there is. 0:9:32.820 --> 0:9:33.290 Will Lytle I'm on. 0:9:33.300 --> 0:9:35.500 Will Lytle We looked at it was planned before the Sprint started. 0:9:35.510 --> 0:9:38.740 Will Lytle It was a low number of tickets and then this Sprint. 0:9:39.790 --> 0:9:42.490 Will Lytle Umm, obviously had a few tickets added into it. 0:9:43.210 --> 0:9:43.550 Will Lytle Umm. 0:9:43.690 --> 0:9:45.870 Will Lytle And to those tickets were completed by the end of the Sprint. 0:9:45.880 --> 0:9:56.100 Will Lytle Now there could be a number of reasons for that could be maybe the, maybe the team had something else planned, they were supporting a production release, or maybe there were a number of people on the team who got sick that week. 0:9:56.110 --> 0:9:56.980 Will Lytle And that's just an anomaly. 0:9:57.260 --> 0:9:57.820 Will Lytle That's fine. 0:9:57.830 --> 0:10:6.320 Will Lytle Like you know, you would expect things like this to happen from time to time in the data point being here is that allows you to get both views of these things. 0:10:6.330 --> 0:10:18.120 Will Lytle Now obviously this Sprint completion takes a hit there when we drop and the reason being of course is given the fact that tickets are being added into the sprints which will come into in a second. 0:10:18.190 --> 0:10:21.480 Will Lytle But it's gonna naturally change what the completion rate is, OK. 0:10:23.180 --> 0:10:27.450 Will Lytle So I'm gonna go back to this view here just very quickly now. 0:10:27.540 --> 0:10:39.570 Will Lytle If you look at what was planned at the start of the Sprint and what was what was included, the start of the Sprint versus what was committed based on what was started, the Sprint doesn't mean that all of your data is completely obfuscated. 0:10:39.800 --> 0:10:42.820 Will Lytle OK, this is where the committed versus completed view is really helpful. 0:10:43.930 --> 0:10:48.840 Will Lytle And with this view here basically looks at everything you're you're full composition of the Sprint. 0:10:49.270 --> 0:10:52.900 Will Lytle OK, the blue bar is always going to be based on what you committed to. 0:10:52.910 --> 0:11:1.850 Will Lytle These are things that entered into the Sprint, whether it happened before the Sprint started or after the Sprint started, and it helps you get an understanding of a couple of different things. 0:11:1.960 --> 0:11:4.150 Will Lytle One is carryover, right? 0:11:4.160 --> 0:11:8.30 Will Lytle I I would argue that this team is reasonably healthy with carryover. 0:11:8.80 --> 0:11:20.210 Will Lytle I've seen teams that are a much higher than 17%, but what the carryover represents is that there is a ticket that was in our previous Sprint that was not completed and that ticket was immediately carried over into the next Sprint. 0:11:20.480 --> 0:11:31.620 Will Lytle So if you think about this in some ways, you might say that 17% of your velocity over time is going to be cannibalized by work that we weren't unfortunately able to get done in the prior Sprint. 0:11:32.170 --> 0:11:36.560 Will Lytle Now again, we don't expect Sprint completion to be 100%, right. 0:11:36.850 --> 0:11:42.240 Will Lytle We do expect there to maybe always be a little bit of carryover and that's why I'm not too worried in this instance. 0:11:42.570 --> 0:11:43.630 Will Lytle You know why 17? 0:11:43.710 --> 0:11:45.670 Will Lytle This is 17%. OK, fine. 0:11:45.680 --> 0:12:7.600 Will Lytle I mean, there's going to be spillover between sprints where this starts to make people nervous is when it gets above 20 percent, 30%, because that starts to mean you're actually really having a kind of statistical cannibalization of your velocity on an ongoing basis and that's something you can you can hit the you can take a hit with one Sprint, but you certainly wouldn't want to see that over time. 0:12:8.210 --> 0:12:17.340 Will Lytle And that's where these views here can be quite helpful, because this helps you distinguish of what we plan for a Sprint, how much of it was new work that we planned right. 0:12:17.350 --> 0:12:23.390 Will Lytle So you can see roughly 50%, just over 50% was new work planned for this Sprint. 0:12:23.660 --> 0:12:24.930 Will Lytle A number of it was carried over. 0:12:24.940 --> 0:12:33.30 Will Lytle Unfortunately, nothing was added as part of this Sprint, but in the next Sprint we had a couple of tickets that were carried over and a couple of tickets that were added mid Sprint. 0:12:33.220 --> 0:12:40.390 Will Lytle So it allows us as a team to really be able to kind of dissect over time what's happening with our data, what's happening with our planning activities. 0:12:40.820 --> 0:12:44.330 Will Lytle Generally speaking, I think this team shows very good patterns right? 0:12:44.340 --> 0:12:52.500 Will Lytle The Farr majority of the work that's going into every Sprint, both from a plant as well as a completed perspective, is based on planned work, right? 0:12:52.690 --> 0:12:58.960 Will Lytle And you have an acceptable threshold of, you know, work being added now, you'll probably have. 0:12:58.970 --> 0:13:0.30 Will Lytle What are these thresholds? 0:13:0.40 --> 0:13:0.410 Will Lytle I don't. 0:13:0.420 --> 0:13:5.460 Will Lytle I don't think there's a benchmark threshold that you can apply for all teams in all situations. 0:13:5.470 --> 0:13:17.980 Will Lytle I think the team, when you're looking at this data, you have to be, you have to kind of understand what you're comfortable with is thresholds that's going to allow you to ultimately to be able to maintain a healthy completion right here, OK. 0:13:20.190 --> 0:13:34.650 Will Lytle That sounds like a bit of a cop out, but I think the important bit is is a team has to draw, has to have a real kind of proximity and understanding to their own data and the thresholds that will allow them ultimately to to maintain the healthy completion rate. 0:13:34.660 --> 0:13:37.350 Will Lytle And some of that might be influenced by carryover. 0:13:37.360 --> 0:13:39.240 Will Lytle Some of it might be influenced by ticket change. 0:13:40.460 --> 0:13:42.220 Will Lytle The ticket change will come into in a second here. 0:13:42.660 --> 0:13:51.630 Will Lytle I'm but that that's where my view is on the on thing now in terms of the ticket change, there are two kind of views on that and try not to make this about training. 0:13:51.640 --> 0:13:54.660 Will Lytle But I think in everybody part of it is about training as we walk through some of these. 0:13:55.630 --> 0:14:2.80 Will Lytle So the scope change will help you get a sense of what's added and removed from a particular Sprint, right? 0:14:2.90 --> 0:14:3.780 Will Lytle So we don't see anything actually being removed. 0:14:3.790 --> 0:14:13.80 Will Lytle What we would expect to see here if there was work being removed is that you'd have a little orange bar below this purple bar, so the purple bar allows you to see the tickets being added each Sprint. 0:14:13.190 --> 0:14:18.160 Will Lytle So we talked a little bit about the Sprint already, but you can see that there's a little bit being added every Sprint. 0:14:18.170 --> 0:14:21.740 Will Lytle And again, that's natural and if you want to, you can click in here. 0:14:21.950 --> 0:14:22.820 Will Lytle See what it is. 0:14:22.970 --> 0:14:25.500 Will Lytle It's unsurprising that a bug gets added to a Sprint right? 0:14:25.510 --> 0:14:29.230 Will Lytle You would typically expect things like bugs to be added to sprints OK. 0:14:31.950 --> 0:14:33.100 Will Lytle But what does that mean? 0:14:33.210 --> 0:14:34.130 Will Lytle Like what is, what is? 0:14:34.140 --> 0:14:36.860 Will Lytle What does that change mean in the context of everything else? 0:14:36.900 --> 0:14:41.500 Will Lytle So the scope change percentage basically takes into consideration. 0:14:41.570 --> 0:14:45.500 Will Lytle So this will show you your gross as in we added we added six but we removed 6. 0:14:45.510 --> 0:14:49.160 Will Lytle So essentially, we maintained a 0% change, right? 0:14:51.860 --> 0:14:57.340 Will Lytle This will show you what you originally had, what you finished with it, what the gross change was, and what the net change was. 0:14:58.180 --> 0:15:5.310 Will Lytle The second view here in terms of the scope change itself will put that in proportion of the overall scope of the team. 0:15:5.740 --> 0:15:12.240 Will Lytle So what it basically means is 35% of that team Sprint scope changed during the course of this. 0:15:12.340 --> 0:15:23.110 Will Lytle So serves a relative view so that you can see, you know, OK, well, maybe we had a lot of tickets added, but the proportionally it was actually a very small level of change as opposed to in this example, more tickets added. 0:15:23.120 --> 0:15:34.930 Will Lytle Actually, a third of our scope changed in this, so that might have an impact as to whether or not, for instance 105, umm, you know, arguably the team did quite well to navigate through that phase. 0:15:35.160 --> 0:15:40.490 Will Lytle OK, so a lot of our clients are really honing in on these patterns, right? 0:15:40.500 --> 0:15:47.190 Will Lytle What's happening in terms of change and what impact that's having, what's happening in terms of carryover work and how can we mitigate that over time? 0:15:48.420 --> 0:15:58.180 Will Lytle How we ultimately driving towards these Sprint completion goals and then obviously looking at the volatility now, the one thing I would add here and I can't demo this cause it doesn't exist in the data. 0:15:59.180 --> 0:16:2.350 Will Lytle Umm, but I don't know if it's something Ideagen's interested in. 0:16:2.360 --> 0:16:13.290 Will Lytle I don't know if it's something that a couple of teams want to trial, but we have a few clients that actually track their Sprint goals and obviously you'll be well aware with Chira. 0:16:13.780 --> 0:16:21.850 Will Lytle There's a goal section at the top, which is basically just unstructured free text, and that's not particularly helpful when you're trying to measure. 0:16:21.860 --> 0:16:27.620 Will Lytle It's good as a UI reminder of what your goals are, but you can't measure that box because that box is just unstructured text. 0:16:28.640 --> 0:16:39.710 Will Lytle So what they do is they create what they call an issue type called the sprinkle and they will treat that like every other ticket like a story or a bug or a a task. 0:16:39.820 --> 0:16:47.640 Will Lytle OK, so I'll create one or two goals or maybe three goals for that Sprint, SO3 separate tickets and they will add it to that Sprint, OK. 0:16:48.520 --> 0:16:58.810 Will Lytle And the reason I love this idea is because this view here is very much focused on the executional side of the tickets themselves, right. 0:16:59.220 --> 0:17:1.930 Will Lytle Whereas there's a kind of a separate question. 0:17:1.940 --> 0:17:10.640 Will Lytle Arguably, maybe even more important, which is regardless of all of this, which helps us understand how we're driving scrum, behavior and managing our sprints. 0:17:11.390 --> 0:17:13.980 Will Lytle To what extent did we accomplish our goals right? 0:17:13.990 --> 0:17:18.790 Will Lytle Because we could deliver all of our tickets, but if we didn't accomplish our goals, that's not great. 0:17:19.30 --> 0:17:25.220 Will Lytle That said, we could deliver 70% of our tickets, which doesn't sound great, but we accomplished all of our goals right. 0:17:25.350 --> 0:17:34.800 Will Lytle So I love your idea because I think it provides teams with a different point of view in terms of the the ultimate thing that you're trying to do here, which is deliver your sprinkles. 0:17:35.30 --> 0:17:39.560 Will Lytle So if there are teams that wanted to do this in, test it and try it out, I definitely recommend it again. 0:17:39.890 --> 0:17:52.640 Will Lytle You probably need help from an admin creating the issue type, but essentially what you can do is you could even trial it with like a task or something like that and then put a label as a Sprint goal. 0:17:52.910 --> 0:17:58.50 Will Lytle But what you basically do is and maybe this isn't the right metric for it. 0:17:58.60 --> 0:18:0.420 Will Lytle You could actually use something like Sprint completion rates. 0:18:0.590 --> 0:18:10.30 Will Lytle So if we go into here and we go down to the one of the Sprint completion rates, you would just apply the filter there to focus on a task with a label of sprinkle. 0:18:10.40 --> 0:18:16.580 Will Lytle Or if you do get an issue type created just the sprinkle and then you can actually see how we're delivering our sprinkles in combination with this. 0:18:17.690 --> 0:18:23.150 Will Lytle And I think that's a very powerful view and a very meaningful view as well when trying to drive motivation. 0:18:24.300 --> 0:18:27.670 Will Lytle Ideagen hasn't done this yet, but I know from working with a lot of our clients. 0:18:28.870 --> 0:18:36.680 Will Lytle This metric here in particular has the highest correlation with engineering satisfaction right. 0:18:36.690 --> 0:18:55.320 Will Lytle In Scrum, teams that we've seen so far, and I think that's common sense, really at the end of the day, because I think if a team is able to consistently scope out their goals and has the opportunity to deliver those goals without priorities changing or things being distracted or whatever, it's highly motivating. 0:18:55.910 --> 0:18:56.140 Speaker 1 Umm. 0:18:55.370 --> 0:19:2.840 Will Lytle Whereas if your scope is always changing and you're always being set up to never quite accomplish what you've told you know you need to accomplish. 0:19:2.930 --> 0:19:6.40 Will Lytle That can be quite demoralizing, especially if it's done on a sustained basis. 0:19:6.50 --> 0:19:25.450 Will Lytle So I do think from a leadership perspective, whether you're a team lead, a scrum master, an engineering manager, you know, whatever your role is and in any form of leadership position, this is really an important metric, not only in terms of your delivery predictability, but also getting a good eye on how do I drive, you know, kind of positive and motivated environment with an engineering organization. 0:19:25.880 --> 0:19:30.800 Will Lytle Obviously, if you're using Scrum, that's not going to be possible, but OK, I'll pause there. 0:19:29.570 --> 0:19:30.860 Speaker 1 OK. Uh. 0:19:30.810 --> 0:19:31.430 Will Lytle Any questions? 0:19:31.440 --> 0:19:31.840 Will Lytle Any comments? 0:19:40.420 --> 0:19:42.530 Emma Woodcock And I'll just. Sorry, go on. 0:19:39.690 --> 0:19:43.190 Speaker 1 I mean, yeah, maybe that could go ahead. 0:19:43.240 --> 0:19:44.910 Speaker 1 Yeah. OK. 0:19:44.590 --> 0:19:48.250 Emma Woodcock I was going to say I quite like the idea of measuring the Sprint goal. 0:19:48.990 --> 0:20:5.60 Emma Woodcock I'm completion because I've that's one thing that I've I've keep noticing when I'm looking at these metrics, is that the percentage of of the Sprint completed doesn't really bear any relation to whether or not we hit the Sprint goal. 0:20:5.590 --> 0:20:14.170 Emma Woodcock And and I was kind of trying to see, you know, how do we square these two sets of data and and what should we read from it? 0:20:14.180 --> 0:20:17.930 Emma Woodcock So yeah, if if there's a way to do that, I'd be quite interested in looking at that. 0:20:20.310 --> 0:20:20.820 Will Lytle 100%. 0:20:20.810 --> 0:20:21.920 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah. 0:20:22.70 --> 0:20:32.280 Speaker 1 View if maybe it has some visuals right on how how it will look like then OK, ask for more feedback for those who would like to try it out. 0:20:34.340 --> 0:20:36.110 Will Lytle I can pretend because I'd like. 0:20:36.990 --> 0:20:39.0 Speaker 1 OK, OK, alright. 0:20:40.810 --> 0:20:41.80 Speaker 1 Umm. 0:20:36.120 --> 0:20:42.970 Will Lytle I guess we don't have the data there, but if for instance you use Sprint completion, the I'll show you how another client sets this up. 0:20:43.420 --> 0:20:44.760 Will Lytle So the Sprint completion here. 0:20:46.770 --> 0:20:52.310 Will Lytle So this just you not too dissimilar to the other metro we're looking at, but just a more simplified view of it. 0:20:52.570 --> 0:20:59.360 Will Lytle But basically, Emma, what you would do is let's imagine you created an issue type called the Sprint Goal, right, which is what this other customer does. 0:20:59.850 --> 0:21:9.480 Will Lytle Essentially what you would do is you'd go into the filter and rather than looking at all tickets in our Sprint, I just want to look at only the Sprint goals and I want to see what was done or not done by the end of the Sprint. 0:21:9.490 --> 0:21:14.600 Will Lytle So did we accomplish the goal and we marked as completed by the end of the Sprint or not? 0:21:17.280 --> 0:21:17.490 Speaker 1 OK. 0:21:18.620 --> 0:21:18.920 Matthew Frater You know. 0:21:14.610 --> 0:21:22.740 Will Lytle And so obviously you don't have one here showing which is the challenge, but let's pretend security was Sprint goal, right? 0:21:23.950 --> 0:21:27.520 Will Lytle I've no idea what's gonna show up in the data here, so let's find out, right. 0:21:27.700 --> 0:21:29.750 Will Lytle Obviously it's not a great view, but it does it. 0:21:29.760 --> 0:21:32.450 Will Lytle It will show you here for instance. 0:21:32.460 --> 0:21:32.730 Will Lytle OK. 0:21:32.740 --> 0:21:36.490 Will Lytle Well, we had one goal last Sprint and 1:05 and we didn't accomplish it. 0:21:36.760 --> 0:21:36.960 Speaker 1 OK. 0:21:36.920 --> 0:21:41.990 Will Lytle We had four goals, which is a lot too many, but whatever, it's the data, right? 0:21:42.0 --> 0:21:43.910 Will Lytle We completed three, but we didn't accomplish one. 0:21:43.920 --> 0:21:48.290 Will Lytle And then in Sprint 7107, we accomplished both the goals, right. 0:21:48.300 --> 0:21:51.290 Will Lytle So on a journey finally got there. 0:21:51.380 --> 0:21:52.110 Will Lytle That sort of thing. 0:21:55.550 --> 0:21:55.760 Speaker 1 OK. 0:21:52.540 --> 0:21:57.30 Will Lytle And that's basically this is the view that they use right now with them. 0:21:57.40 --> 0:21:58.220 Will Lytle It's a very binary question. 0:21:58.630 --> 0:22:1.700 Will Lytle They either accomplished all goals or they didn't accomplish any goals. 0:22:1.710 --> 0:22:2.990 Will Lytle Is the way that they handle it now. 0:22:3.0 --> 0:22:7.20 Will Lytle That's obviously the decision for you to make within your teams and your product area. 0:22:7.150 --> 0:22:9.30 Will Lytle I kind of like that because it's a very binary. 0:22:9.40 --> 0:22:11.820 Will Lytle You either completed what you said out to accomplish or you didn't. 0:22:11.900 --> 0:22:18.470 Will Lytle There's no partial victories in Sprint goals, which is which is harsh but fair, I think. Umm. 0:22:20.470 --> 0:22:26.380 Will Lytle And then that gives them an overarching view that like you know, 60% of the time will accomplish our goals, which is definitely something you want to work on. 0:22:27.130 --> 0:22:29.680 Will Lytle If that was the case, poor emergent. 0:22:29.690 --> 0:22:43.300 Will Lytle We're looking at their security issues, but again, as I mentioned, you know, umm, I suspension of disbelief now just punches of time. It's 25 past. 0:22:43.310 --> 0:22:44.860 Will Lytle I'll I'll move through a few of the more. 0:22:44.910 --> 0:22:49.880 Will Lytle I tried to accommodate some of the what I wanted to look at was more the aging WIP one. 0:22:49.890 --> 0:22:53.850 Will Lytle This is relatively newer metric, one that's been around now for a couple of months. 0:22:55.850 --> 0:23:12.510 Will Lytle It would aging WIP does or what's in intended to do is give you a kind of a real time view throughout certain stages, certain defined stages of your SDLC where your live tickets are relative to where similar tickets have been historically on their way to being delivered. 0:23:12.830 --> 0:23:21.490 Will Lytle OK, now a lot of clients when they first look at this metric will look at something like this because inevitably there will be hygiene work that needs to be done. 0:23:21.500 --> 0:23:28.700 Will Lytle So there is a task that is in development and has been in development for 458 days. 0:23:28.810 --> 0:23:32.860 Will Lytle I am guessing that that is probably not gonna be done and probably just needs to be closed off. 0:23:32.950 --> 0:23:36.860 Will Lytle So like, I guess surprisingly to me, I wasn't expecting the. 0:23:36.900 --> 0:23:39.40 Will Lytle There's so much hygiene to be used for this. 0:23:39.50 --> 0:23:40.580 Will Lytle At first, that's the case. 0:23:40.590 --> 0:23:44.700 Will Lytle Now I'm just going to filter out tasks at the moment so that we can get a more normalized view of the data. 0:23:44.790 --> 0:23:53.20 Will Lytle So it's less kind of red and basically what you would do with this metric and what a lot of clients this is particularly critical for a Kanban team. 0:23:53.90 --> 0:23:55.950 Will Lytle In fact, arguably the most important metric for a can ban team. 0:23:55.960 --> 0:24:3.280 Will Lytle But I do think that scrum teams equally can get a lot of value, but also at the same time live view is doing similar things with this. 0:24:3.890 --> 0:24:15.660 Will Lytle But essentially what this view allows you to see is you might say, OK, I only wanna focus focus on certain stages of the SDLC, so I've picked the stages that I care about. 0:24:15.700 --> 0:24:17.750 Will Lytle I kind of your cycle time from one way. 0:24:17.760 --> 0:24:20.150 Will Lytle Start development until we deliver to something. 0:24:20.240 --> 0:24:21.830 Will Lytle It covers all of these statuses. 0:24:22.360 --> 0:24:23.590 Will Lytle I want to focus. 0:24:23.640 --> 0:24:33.840 Will Lytle I've done this mostly for hygiene and the like, making it look clean and this example is focusing only on stories and support issues, but you might want to include bugs and so on. 0:24:34.690 --> 0:24:40.890 Will Lytle Basically what this is showing you is all of your inflight work, so we can see that we have one umm ticket here. 0:24:41.810 --> 0:24:55.990 Will Lytle The story, which is 8 points and it's currently in development now, it has been in development now for roughly 9 days, right, which puts it into the 85th percentile, probably halfway through the 85th percentile. 0:24:56.0 --> 0:25:0.870 Will Lytle So maybe closer somewhere to the 90th percentile compared to how we've historically worked. 0:25:1.220 --> 0:25:13.30 Will Lytle Now, this team in particular, because they have such a high time in development, right, there's a big kind of jump between these two in development and kind of the the code review in progress stages. 0:25:13.40 --> 0:25:14.370 Will Lytle I didn't know which one was being used. 0:25:14.380 --> 0:25:22.220 Will Lytle Still, I mean in progress might not actually be required anymore if it's been replaced by in development, so I'm gonna remove that for a second. 0:25:23.140 --> 0:25:23.690 Will Lytle Umm. 0:25:24.80 --> 0:25:31.110 Will Lytle But essentially what this shows you is where the ticket is currently compared to historical tickets, at what percentile? 0:25:31.120 --> 0:25:33.690 Will Lytle So right now it's, you know, 85th percentile. 0:25:35.350 --> 0:25:39.490 Will Lytle We're entering in the 85th percentile, cause I've removed the in progress from the overall calculation. 0:25:39.950 --> 0:25:57.400 Will Lytle Now, if this ticket is moved into code review, it will still remain in that, but if we're able to actually get it through into ready for test today that it will suddenly move below there and it will move into the 71st, 70th percentile, right? 0:25:57.620 --> 0:25:58.940 Will Lytle So it shows you kind of. 0:25:59.310 --> 0:26:10.430 Will Lytle If you were to kind of work through this and prioritize it today, it would basically move directly right across this chart and would show you ultimately where it will land relative to the historical data for that team, right. 0:26:11.0 --> 0:26:20.390 Will Lytle Typically, you'd expect to see more of a pop, pop, pop pop up, but the reason for this team why it's kind of shaped in this way is very largely because of. 0:26:22.460 --> 0:26:24.630 Will Lytle This metric here, which is their cycle time. 0:26:25.120 --> 0:26:36.590 Will Lytle OK, so the team doesn't actually spend a lot of time comparatively and ready for tests and in test and awaiting merge and blocked in code review, all of these things are relatively short comparative to the cycle time. 0:26:37.960 --> 0:26:44.450 Will Lytle But this would be, you know, you're looking at a story 14 days in development for a single story is is quite high. 0:26:46.160 --> 0:26:55.650 Will Lytle You know, typically you would expect, especially if it's a scrum team, you would expect an average story to be far less than the amount of days and an actual Sprint. 0:26:55.660 --> 0:27:14.260 Will Lytle But this is actually the same amount of days as an actual Sprint, so it suggests to me that either there's something going on with the hygiene or uh, you know, if I'm this team here I'm I'm thinking, OK, do we need to start breaking down our stories a bit more because if if these are representative of the size, then perhaps yes, Matthew. 0:27:16.460 --> 0:27:17.50 Matthew Frater Yeah. Hi. 0:27:17.60 --> 0:27:17.930 Matthew Frater Well, thank you. 0:27:18.40 --> 0:27:28.610 Matthew Frater But the question I've got really relates to what, what, what you're thinking about it for a story fails, QA gets put back into development after being everybody thought ready to merge. 0:27:31.610 --> 0:27:32.230 Will Lytle In terms of. 0:27:31.470 --> 0:27:32.370 Matthew Frater Like can you account for that? 0:27:36.610 --> 0:27:36.840 Matthew Frater Yeah. 0:27:34.280 --> 0:27:38.150 Will Lytle So it will still show you that time overall, right? 0:27:38.270 --> 0:27:45.100 Will Lytle I think where and this is I was actually interested in looking at this for this particular one, so there's a metric and I did this because we had a team. 0:27:45.110 --> 0:27:52.50 Will Lytle There's actually a webinar from one of our teams that was looking at this problem and there was what was clear is the team was oversizing their issues. 0:27:54.630 --> 0:27:56.10 Will Lytle We're not even oversizing. 0:27:56.20 --> 0:28:2.70 Will Lytle They were accepting too many eights and fives coming into their sprints rather than challenging those and trying to break them down. 0:28:2.80 --> 0:28:23.0 Will Lytle And as a result, there's a lot of risk being carried in, so there is a there is a metric here that kind of works in collaboration with that, which is your return rate and this allows you to specifically pick any transition between statuses that for you might represent a regression, OK and then it will show you the proportion of time that your tickets are regressing. 0:28:23.10 --> 0:28:24.220 Will Lytle So example here. 0:28:24.230 --> 0:28:25.820 Will Lytle I've picked all of these transitions. 0:28:26.400 --> 0:28:34.90 Will Lytle I've focused purely on stories and tasks, and I can see that on average our return rate is 20%, which isn't particularly high. 0:28:35.40 --> 0:28:53.290 Will Lytle Umm, I was expecting maybe to see it be a little bit higher for a team that spends, you know if if if the tickets are that high then that the other way of being able to look at that is actually something that's in the current North Star metrics which is this relationship here of stories and tasks, livered versus bugs and defects created. 0:28:53.600 --> 0:29:2.400 Will Lytle So you want to have a much higher proportion of stories and tasks delivered than bugs created in order to kind of demonstrate that a team is effectively breaking things down? 0:29:2.410 --> 0:29:12.170 Will Lytle That's one of the reasons why this is such an effective metric to generally looking at the high correlation between those two, the choose to break down the two, going back to your specific question, what do I think about it? 0:29:13.390 --> 0:29:20.410 Will Lytle Obviously, anything that is regressing is, you know you, you you want to be able to apportion that time realistically. 0:29:21.680 --> 0:29:25.800 Will Lytle So if you if if in development is so high because of a high return rate. 0:29:27.750 --> 0:29:35.960 Will Lytle Then you should be able to see that very clearly evidenced here in the return rate or there's another one called first time pass rate, which kind of measures the opposite of this. 0:29:36.970 --> 0:29:39.480 Will Lytle You'd also be able to see potentially in the bug resolution time. 0:29:39.490 --> 0:29:42.410 Will Lytle How much is being done so that those are two ways of looking at it? 0:29:46.690 --> 0:29:50.130 Will Lytle Umm, the bug resolution time. 0:29:52.690 --> 0:29:58.190 Will Lytle At the time which PR is going to skip to this one, first, the time to merge PR's is quite an interesting one. 0:29:58.290 --> 0:30:2.840 Will Lytle Most most teams are trying to give time to merge PR's within 24 hours. 0:30:3.750 --> 0:30:10.160 Will Lytle OK, now there are some interesting themes I think we spoke about this some weeks ago. 0:30:10.220 --> 0:30:18.990 Will Lytle So so this this looks essentially the more or less the code review process right from a PR being open to being reviewed, commented, and ultimately merged. 0:30:19.460 --> 0:30:40.180 Will Lytle And I don't know if this applies to this specific team, but when you look at how these Piers break down by different repositories, right there is the potential I think for for for some teams where if they're working in a shared environment where they're dependent on other other team, naturally their PR's are going to start to take a lot longer. 0:30:40.350 --> 0:30:42.140 Will Lytle I think we were looking at this a couple of months ago. 0:30:44.750 --> 0:30:54.260 Will Lytle The team that was we were looking at, I think I had three or four repositories and the ones that they kind of maintain themselves that are very good Sprint time to merge PR's. 0:30:55.440 --> 0:30:57.80 Will Lytle But there is a different one. 0:30:57.90 --> 0:31:2.650 Will Lytle Again, I don't know if it's this or a different, but it definitely wasn't this, but I don't know if this is a shared repository or not. 0:31:2.660 --> 0:31:10.230 Will Lytle What was quite clear is that there's a high correlation with, you know, the more the word dependent on other teams being involved in the pull request process. 0:31:10.440 --> 0:31:13.130 Will Lytle It had a factor of eight times of slow. 0:31:13.220 --> 0:31:15.370 Will Lytle Now, why does this matter so much? 0:31:15.700 --> 0:31:16.110 Will Lytle Really. 0:31:16.120 --> 0:31:21.130 Will Lytle Because the time to merge PR for most clients represents about 20 to 30% of your cycle time. 0:31:21.970 --> 0:31:26.740 Will Lytle Now you figure the average cycle time right now for a story is about 16.6 days. 0:31:27.650 --> 0:31:36.570 Will Lytle It takes 100 hours, so you know roughly 4 days to get through the actual Peru request process on average, right? 0:31:39.50 --> 0:31:42.580 Will Lytle I can't tell you the reasons why this is, but for me this is. 0:31:43.590 --> 0:31:44.830 Will Lytle This is a big flag, right? 0:31:44.840 --> 0:31:48.930 Will Lytle This is this is something that has a developed, you know, set up like a development team. 0:31:48.940 --> 0:31:55.150 Will Lytle I want to actually explore this and understand what's driving which drive in this data right. 0:31:57.770 --> 0:32:10.820 Will Lytle Is it dependencies on other teams and therefore maybe we need to get to, you know, get together with the other team leads and try to figure out a way of of optimizing this process a little bit or splitting out the code base and being able to allocate responsibility little bit differently. 0:32:10.830 --> 0:32:27.800 Will Lytle This is arguably, I think one of the big areas to consider and do to take a look at time to review is pretty solid, but it ultimately it's about time to get approval, which either means there's a lot of back and forth or ultimately got. 0:32:27.810 --> 0:32:34.340 Will Lytle I can tell you, I mean that that an engineering team can have a very quick and sensible conversation about trying to identify what are the reasons behind these. 0:32:35.250 --> 0:32:35.990 Will Lytle Yes, drum. 0:32:37.30 --> 0:32:37.440 Speaker 1 You want. 0:32:37.450 --> 0:32:52.910 Speaker 1 The concern is that like here is a people are maybe try to avoid some something, a pull request on a Friday because you know Saturday and Sunday will be counted and then that will spike out. 0:32:53.110 --> 0:32:54.180 Speaker 1 So what was your thought on that? 0:32:56.270 --> 0:33:0.830 Will Lytle I think statistically speaking, you'll find that that's not the case if you look at the days. 0:33:3.610 --> 0:33:3.940 Will Lytle So. 0:33:6.940 --> 0:33:8.140 Will Lytle I think if people's. 0:33:11.180 --> 0:33:16.870 Will Lytle If the takeaway here is to stop working on Fridays because it might carry over to the weekend, I think we've sort of missed the point. 0:33:18.780 --> 0:33:19.0 Will Lytle Right. 0:33:19.570 --> 0:33:21.170 Will Lytle Umm no. 0:33:21.230 --> 0:33:21.980 Will Lytle If, if. 0:33:21.990 --> 0:33:24.160 Will Lytle If that's the ultimate takeaway, I that's fine. 0:33:24.170 --> 0:33:26.80 Will Lytle But I think I'm. 0:33:26.260 --> 0:33:27.230 Will Lytle I don't know what to tell you. 0:33:27.240 --> 0:33:34.990 Will Lytle There at room, I think that's a conversation you need to have with the teams, cause I think that's quite clearly the the wrong outcome to have here on these metrics, right. 0:33:36.910 --> 0:33:37.730 Will Lytle For obvious reasons. 0:33:42.370 --> 0:33:43.510 Will Lytle Some PR count. 0:33:44.70 --> 0:33:53.130 Will Lytle This is not a view that I don't think a lot of people have looked at yet, and I wanted to show you guys this Peter the yeah, one move on. 0:33:51.600 --> 0:33:57.490 Peter Swanborough Umm is it not possible to simply omit non working days from the data? 0:33:59.820 --> 0:34:10.650 Will Lytle I'm not particularly because the concept of working day, even in an idea Gen, means a lot of different things and we have no idea where the person is based on, so we don't remove that overall. 0:34:11.40 --> 0:34:22.900 Will Lytle Plus, our argument is is time is actual time, whether it's working days or not, because the majority of time that you don't spend working actually happens in the evenings over the course of the week, not on the weekends, right? 0:34:22.910 --> 0:34:25.780 Will Lytle So you'd actually, if you wanted to see purely by working hours. 0:34:26.110 --> 0:34:30.260 Will Lytle Unfortunately, we'd have to know exactly who sits where, what their current working hours are. 0:34:31.40 --> 0:34:31.580 Will Lytle Umm. 0:34:31.720 --> 0:34:35.730 Will Lytle And that's not something we can easily do kind of globally across all of the different teams. 0:34:35.740 --> 0:34:38.280 Will Lytle And you know, we have people based in Asia. 0:34:38.290 --> 0:34:39.580 Will Lytle You have people based in Europe. 0:34:39.590 --> 0:34:43.760 Will Lytle You have people based, I think, even in the US so we show the data as it is. 0:34:44.570 --> 0:34:44.980 Peter Swanborough OK. 0:34:45.740 --> 0:34:46.110 Peter Swanborough Thank you. 0:34:47.80 --> 0:34:56.590 Will Lytle Or it's umm, now the breakdowns up PR count I think is where you can have some quite interesting conversations here. 0:35:0.170 --> 0:35:3.960 Will Lytle Point to this just looks at the the number of PR's right? 0:35:3.970 --> 0:35:6.740 Will Lytle And I'm going to just look at productive PR's at the moment. 0:35:6.750 --> 0:35:8.460 Will Lytle I appear ours at alternately merged. 0:35:9.410 --> 0:35:25.40 Will Lytle OK, now the reason I like this metric and again this is sumes that it's being interpreted the right way because it's very easy to interpret this in a very naive way, which is to look at PR count by author as some form of productivity. 0:35:25.630 --> 0:35:39.40 Will Lytle I think it in part in forms it, but you need to have a more sophisticated understanding of how developers are intended to spend their time between writing code, designing, supporting others and so on and so forth. 0:35:39.250 --> 0:35:44.830 Will Lytle But I do think that this gives you a meaningful portion of the view on that basis. 0:35:44.840 --> 0:35:47.10 Will Lytle So you can take a look at the PR count by author. 0:35:47.860 --> 0:35:54.750 Will Lytle You can break that down here and actually see the size of the PR's, so there are a number of clients that use this on a regular basis. 0:35:54.760 --> 0:36:1.30 Will Lytle To see all we actually make, are we creating PR's that are too large and that's bringing in additional risk? 0:36:1.40 --> 0:36:4.0 Will Lytle Are there certain individuals that are doing that now? 0:36:4.10 --> 0:36:5.580 Will Lytle I can't say that I've been doing this. 0:36:5.690 --> 0:36:6.570 Will Lytle You know, I would doubt that. 0:36:6.580 --> 0:36:9.420 Will Lytle I've been literally wrote 12,000 lines of code. 0:36:9.490 --> 0:36:12.100 Will Lytle If you did bless him, that's incredible. 0:36:12.200 --> 0:36:18.20 Will Lytle It's probably more of a library change here, but that library change even still in, you know, provides some level of risk. 0:36:18.30 --> 0:36:29.400 Will Lytle So from this perspective you can look at it from a throughput perspective, but also by the sizing perspective of it where I think this data is particularly interesting is if I look at it, this data broken down by participant. 0:36:29.690 --> 0:36:42.800 Will Lytle So overall, we had 75 PR that have been merged over the course of the last 12 weeks for this particular team, we can see how many of those PR's have been, uh, you know, done by author. 0:36:42.810 --> 0:36:45.450 Will Lytle So how does that 75 breakdown across the different authors? 0:36:46.510 --> 0:36:50.60 Will Lytle Participant shows you something very different, right? 0:36:50.70 --> 0:37:1.190 Will Lytle So there's Hafiz here, so one might look at this chart and think OK Hafiz is not a particularly productive member of this team, right? 0:37:1.660 --> 0:37:4.670 Will Lytle Which is exactly why I'm always very cautious about these metrics. 0:37:5.100 --> 0:37:18.720 Will Lytle The reality, if I look at this data by participant, I see something very different, which is I see that Avis is actually one of the most essential Members of this team because they are of the 75 PR's that have been merged. 0:37:18.950 --> 0:37:21.320 Will Lytle He has participated in 43 of them. 0:37:21.970 --> 0:37:23.580 Will Lytle I he has commented on them. 0:37:23.590 --> 0:37:24.560 Will Lytle He has reviewed them. 0:37:24.570 --> 0:37:25.420 Will Lytle He has merged them. 0:37:25.430 --> 0:37:28.980 Will Lytle He has approved them, so the role that he is playing is slightly different. 0:37:28.990 --> 0:37:42.300 Will Lytle So if you are an engineering lead, right, this is something a lot of our clients look at because it starts to then bring a more sophisticated view of the roles of different people are playing in the team and whether, for instance, you might think that you know Hafiz, this is great that you're doing this. 0:37:42.310 --> 0:37:46.490 Will Lytle But actually I need you to kind of I think we've we've overcorrected in this direction, right. 0:37:46.500 --> 0:37:49.720 Will Lytle I wanna, you know, maybe we should look at finding a little bit more balance next month, right? 0:37:49.730 --> 0:37:52.290 Will Lytle Because I do need you to actually work on XY and Z. 0:37:53.850 --> 0:38:2.360 Will Lytle On the flip side, you can see that certain people might just be authoring but not participating, right, and so there might be a conversation there around I. 0:38:3.90 --> 0:38:13.750 Will Lytle It's great that you're so productive from, you know, from a PR perspective, but I need you to work a little bit more on supporting different people on the team because the more we depend on one person, then the longer these things are gonna take. 0:38:13.760 --> 0:38:17.760 Will Lytle And this kind of goes hand in hand with the collaboration metric. 0:38:18.70 --> 0:38:22.710 Will Lytle Now, I would say generally with this diagram here, it's incredibly healthy, right? 0:38:23.850 --> 0:38:29.840 Will Lytle For those that that haven't used this metric before, it's not a metric in the sense of of a number. 0:38:29.950 --> 0:38:34.340 Will Lytle But what this shows you is the individual interactions in the pull request process. 0:38:34.510 --> 0:38:45.380 Will Lytle So who is working with whom and what proportion of time are people supporting others so you can see the outside of it will show you the proportion of things, proportion of participants who they're actually participating with. 0:38:45.570 --> 0:38:47.800 Will Lytle So you can see patterns of participation. 0:38:48.50 --> 0:38:53.120 Will Lytle For instance, certain people only working with other people, but you can see broadly what you're aiming for. 0:38:53.130 --> 0:38:56.970 Will Lytle Here is a fairly well balanced and distributed distribution across these. 0:38:57.280 --> 0:39:2.390 Will Lytle Now we're looking at a whole bunch of repositories, so this is more around People collaboration. 0:39:2.400 --> 0:39:4.540 Will Lytle But if you wanted to look at selenium for instance. 0:39:6.780 --> 0:39:18.350 Will Lytle And this might not be a good example of it, but selenium shows us something maybe slightly different, which is when we're working in this area of the code base, actually we're very reliant on Siri. 0:39:18.700 --> 0:39:26.310 Will Lytle Now again, this is sliding into this could be this could be something totally different, but imagine it is a just a normal repository, right? 0:39:26.410 --> 0:39:47.960 Will Lytle This could suggest that either there's a potential single point of failure and knowledge, or that one person is picking on taking on too much of the responsibility and the team would actually become far more efficient if that responsibility for reviewing PR's was distributed, which is to be part process change, part confidence building, but also part knowledge distribution. 0:39:48.500 --> 0:39:57.10 Will Lytle So a lot of our clients use this very heavily for identifying areas of their code base where there appears to be knowledge centralized in one person. 0:39:57.370 --> 0:40:1.760 Will Lytle That's a risk, obviously from a knowledge perspective, but also not going to do anything to speed the team up. 0:40:2.710 --> 0:40:7.220 Will Lytle Also, they look at it a lot for new joiners, so I can see for instance. 0:40:8.220 --> 0:40:10.910 Will Lytle But let's say it's Sateesh has just joined the team. 0:40:10.960 --> 0:40:13.870 Will Lytle I can see that you know in the last on Thor. 0:40:13.930 --> 0:40:19.460 Will Lytle No, he's just started getting involved, but actually it's part of his development program and on boarding process. 0:40:19.470 --> 0:40:23.970 Will Lytle And I want him to be working to review and approve more of the PR's. 0:40:24.350 --> 0:40:25.390 Will Lytle Right. So. 0:40:27.420 --> 0:40:45.870 Will Lytle Those 3 metrics, I think in combination or three views, the PR count by approver by participation and by PR collaboration really give a team lead some very interesting things to think about and potentially talk about as part of their risk mitigation with knowledge, knowledge distribution as well as onboarding new folks on our team. 0:40:51.140 --> 0:40:51.570 Will Lytle Umm. 0:40:52.760 --> 0:40:58.890 Will Lytle Last but not least is is the bug resolution time and I won't spend a lot of time on this because it is what it is right? 0:40:58.900 --> 0:41:2.520 Will Lytle How long does it take for us from a bug being open to being resolved, but? 0:41:5.160 --> 0:41:6.460 Will Lytle Why does this matter? 0:41:6.930 --> 0:41:8.920 Will Lytle I'm and and why do people care about it? 0:41:8.930 --> 0:41:15.20 Will Lytle So much so there's the obvious answer to this, which is if there's a bug, it probably impacts our users, and that's not good. 0:41:15.130 --> 0:41:19.800 Will Lytle And so the longer that thing exists, the more our user impacted and that's not good, right? 0:41:19.850 --> 0:41:27.400 Will Lytle That's the obvious answer, but where high performing to a lot of our clients are looking at this is is from a slightly different perspective. 0:41:27.410 --> 0:41:33.950 Will Lytle So this metric obviously only looks at the looks at all the bugs that you have completed, right? 0:41:33.960 --> 0:41:37.630 Will Lytle So they were important enough to complete the question. 0:41:37.640 --> 0:41:45.380 Will Lytle Here is 1 on resource utilization and how effectively we're spending our time to to resolve bugs. 0:41:45.930 --> 0:41:47.960 Will Lytle If I am an engineer, right? 0:41:48.320 --> 0:41:53.820 Will Lytle And I've just written a new feature and that feature has gone into QA. 0:41:54.830 --> 0:42:4.400 Will Lytle If I get a bug back the next day, it's going to typically be relatively trivial for me to fix that bug, assuming it's not something fundamentally wrong in the logic, right? 0:42:5.190 --> 0:42:16.510 Will Lytle However, if that bug sits in a backlog for 55 days on average, right, and obviously there's this one here, couple here that are skewing this a bit. 0:42:17.320 --> 0:42:21.520 Will Lytle So I'm going to just for the sake of mass, move this even to 85%. 0:42:25.560 --> 0:42:25.860 Will Lytle OK. 0:42:25.870 --> 0:42:27.410 Will Lytle Brings it down a little bit. 0:42:27.420 --> 0:42:28.0 Will Lytle Still not enough? 0:42:28.10 --> 0:42:29.170 Will Lytle There's still a few more up there. 0:42:29.340 --> 0:42:32.180 Will Lytle I think there was a bulk closure here where they were closed as resolved. 0:42:32.190 --> 0:42:32.870 Will Lytle There's something but. 0:42:34.880 --> 0:42:36.430 Will Lytle Yeah, yeah, alright. 0:42:38.930 --> 0:42:40.280 Will Lytle We'll get there eventually. 0:42:41.690 --> 0:42:42.290 Will Lytle Maybe we won't. 0:42:46.200 --> 0:42:58.290 Will Lytle Would recommend that if you do do bulk closures, please make sure you mark them as resolution not done so that you have a way of actually excluding them from the data because those were just closed as done. 0:42:58.620 --> 0:43:0.20 Will Lytle But I'm guessing they weren't all done. 0:43:0.30 --> 0:43:6.420 Will Lytle I'm guessing that was just built closure of hygiene, but let's say that this was more realistic, right? 0:43:6.430 --> 0:43:8.620 Will Lytle And this is a lot more healthy, right? 0:43:8.630 --> 0:43:15.670 Will Lytle Because what this is then saying is that an average, you know, our tickets are going to developers and then they can resolve within 9.3 days. 0:43:15.990 --> 0:43:28.190 Will Lytle The difference here being is that the longer it takes for you to resolve bugs right, the longer the time is between the work we are doing in the code base that originally created this bug versus when this bug came back to us. 0:43:29.80 --> 0:43:37.70 Will Lytle And it is significantly faster for developer to have work on short feedback loops and resolve these quickly, which is going to have a direct impact on the productivity of a team. 0:43:37.500 --> 0:43:51.270 Will Lytle Now this is part responsibility of the team, but really part responsibility of the product owner as well, because if the product owner is just prioritizing stories at the consequence of bugs and that bug backlog is building up over time, they are forcing this problem. 0:43:52.300 --> 0:43:56.570 Will Lytle Obviously unknowing me, you know, nobody nobody knowingly makes this problem in thing. 0:43:56.580 --> 0:43:59.590 Will Lytle But the reality is, is we are all working to Rd maps. 0:43:59.600 --> 0:44:17.290 Will Lytle Plandek is working to Rd maps and so we are making conscious decisions on our side to make sure that we are very, very keen on keeping this number as low as possible because we know that it takes they say something like for after two weeks it takes the develop after three days it takes the developer 8 times as long. 0:44:17.300 --> 0:44:19.470 Will Lytle I'm not sure I totally buy that or how that was measured. 0:44:19.720 --> 0:44:23.630 Will Lytle Point being here is it does take a developer a hell of a lot longer to go back. 0:44:23.640 --> 0:44:24.930 Will Lytle Remember what they're working on? 0:44:24.940 --> 0:44:27.390 Will Lytle Look through the code base and trying to figure out what is that thing. 0:44:28.500 --> 0:44:36.420 Will Lytle Whereas if the bug was reported to them a day later, they'd be much easier to be able to be much easier for them to be able to OHS this, resolve it and move on in life. 0:44:36.600 --> 0:44:38.470 Will Lytle And that has a huge impact on capacity. 0:44:38.760 --> 0:44:43.280 Will Lytle What the team has the ability to get through and a particular Sprint, so I would definitely take that in mind. 0:44:44.40 --> 0:44:49.320 Will Lytle Umm, now on the Kanban side, I'm I'm conscious there are some can ban teams here. 0:44:50.210 --> 0:44:53.200 Will Lytle I won't spend a lot of time didactically going through campaign. 0:44:54.790 --> 0:45:2.40 Will Lytle There is an article which we've pointed to a large number of times that we've written E that corresponds to this dashboard. 0:45:2.50 --> 0:45:2.740 Will Lytle If you spell it correctly. 0:45:5.190 --> 0:45:5.890 Will Lytle Umm. 0:45:7.170 --> 0:45:8.970 Will Lytle Which is Key Cam then METRICS. 0:45:8.980 --> 0:45:12.420 Will Lytle I'm Plandek and this is a refresher on, you know, Cam band. 0:45:12.430 --> 0:45:13.280 Will Lytle What is Cam band? 0:45:13.290 --> 0:45:18.980 Will Lytle What are the behaviors you're trying to optimize for more of the kind of background context and introduce introduce to some of the metrics. 0:45:19.630 --> 0:45:27.120 Will Lytle This article works hand in hand with this, but ultimately the end of the day if you're doing Kanban, you shouldn't be doing Kanban because you're trying to avoid doing sprints. 0:45:27.590 --> 0:45:28.860 Will Lytle But that's not the right reason. 0:45:28.930 --> 0:45:39.120 Will Lytle I know that's a common reason, but it's not the right reason I'm if you're trying to do Cam ban, it's because you're effectively trying to drive a system where you're balancing input and output, right? 0:45:39.370 --> 0:45:46.650 Will Lytle And you're able to balance that system through effectively identifying alleviating waste in that process and you're able to. 0:45:48.720 --> 0:45:54.110 Will Lytle Work on tickets work on a backlog of similarly sized items, right? 0:45:54.120 --> 0:45:58.650 Will Lytle So the can man team needs this similar size that items in order to be able to drive and measure the right behaviors. 0:45:59.710 --> 0:46:17.40 Will Lytle So lead time to value we've we've spoken about a little bit cycle time from Dev start to done time to merge PR S We've talked about already, throughput is your main measure here of throughput from the system and what you need to be able to do is balance throughput with input into that system. 0:46:17.150 --> 0:46:26.300 Will Lytle So you can see here is this system is relatively well balanced, 56 in 150 out in terms of what's created versus what's completed into the system. 0:46:26.310 --> 0:46:27.100 Will Lytle Into the system. 0:46:27.490 --> 0:46:41.160 Will Lytle Now there is an argument here that there is a strong backlog right, and the only way that this team is currently going to be able to burn down that backlog with the system input and output as is, is by increasing the output or slowing the input to be honest. 0:46:41.170 --> 0:46:42.500 Will Lytle But you're not going to. 0:46:42.510 --> 0:46:43.630 Will Lytle You're not going to slow input. 0:46:43.690 --> 0:46:44.480 Will Lytle Let's be honest. 0:46:44.570 --> 0:46:52.260 Will Lytle So you can either do that through elevating ways in the process, or by upscaling or upsizing the capacity of the team. 0:46:52.750 --> 0:47:0.970 Will Lytle OK, so the flow efficiency which will partially work will help you to measure the proportion of time that tickets are actively being worked on. 0:47:0.980 --> 0:47:5.510 Will Lytle And this is an essential one for Kanban teams, but also I think very useful for Scrum teams. 0:47:6.230 --> 0:47:8.170 Will Lytle But maybe in a slightly different part of that process. 0:47:8.180 --> 0:47:19.830 Will Lytle But basically what this shows you of all the tickets that we have delivered over the last 12 weeks, if we define these databases as the statuses where somebody was actively working on the ticket, essentially how much time was that ticket queuing? 0:47:19.920 --> 0:47:29.260 Will Lytle What proportion of time was that taking, queuing and so the time it was active over the over the total time is essentially your workflow efficiency, otherwise known as your flow efficiency. 0:47:29.310 --> 0:47:41.100 Will Lytle So one of your key flow metrics now this would be somewhat depending on the workflow, but you can see exactly why this can't be so useful for a team to be able to identify waste in their process. 0:47:41.410 --> 0:47:42.600 Will Lytle So this will color code. 0:47:42.610 --> 0:47:52.520 Will Lytle The active is orange and inactive or queuing is blue and you can see exactly where the largest amount of queuing time is picked up by this particular team. 0:47:53.530 --> 0:47:53.790 Will Lytle What was? 0:47:53.800 --> 0:47:56.90 Will Lytle You could potentially argue, but it could be closed. 0:47:56.100 --> 0:47:57.780 Will Lytle But removed from this metric. 0:47:58.80 --> 0:48:4.700 Will Lytle But this allows you then to like visualize that active in queuing, similar to actually how the workflow is set up itself. 0:48:4.790 --> 0:48:22.90 Will Lytle So if you wanted to improve the work efficient deploy efficiency of this team, right, the backlog is kind of critical area, either the ultimate backlog or the ready for development backlog are the kind of two areas that are critical awaiting refinement as well that. 0:48:24.480 --> 0:48:24.910 Will Lytle Umm. 0:48:26.430 --> 0:48:30.540 Will Lytle 8 minutes left before I, before I go into anything else. 0:48:30.550 --> 0:48:33.610 Will Lytle I guess I wanted to pause and. 0:48:36.980 --> 0:48:41.300 Will Lytle Happened to use the next 9 minutes going over any specific questions or specific use cases. 0:48:42.580 --> 0:48:44.600 Will Lytle I'm there. 0:48:44.610 --> 0:48:55.700 Will Lytle There are a load of different use cases and so it's hard for me sometimes to be able to just randomly generate potential use cases, but hopefully some of these been helpful today, but if there's any real ones I think that would be yes, yes ma'am. 0:48:57.140 --> 0:48:58.450 Mah Jin-Khai Just one question though. 0:48:58.460 --> 0:48:59.450 Mah Jin-Khai What is the? 0:48:59.820 --> 0:49:3.280 Mah Jin-Khai What is the expectation and definition of the high performance teams? 0:49:4.140 --> 0:49:9.480 Mah Jin-Khai Is there a meeting all the target of the metrics or they they something else we need to we need to know? 0:49:12.900 --> 0:49:16.130 Will Lytle I'm getting my definition and then whether you buy it or not is up to you. 0:49:17.520 --> 0:49:19.90 Will Lytle Umm, we don't. 0:49:19.320 --> 0:49:30.190 Will Lytle We don't have anything in our tool that declares you or high performing or not, and the reason being is because there's a lot of context behind teams that we will never understand because of the data that we're looking at. 0:49:30.230 --> 0:49:33.700 Will Lytle So I don't know, for instance, that you're working on a desktop application. 0:49:33.710 --> 0:49:45.910 Will Lytle That's reasonably gonna be deployed once a quarter or maybe even once a year versus you're working on cloud native apps in AWS and you can see how both of those contexts would significantly change the type of data that we would see. 0:49:45.920 --> 0:49:50.450 Will Lytle So Plandek does not prescribe any sort of performance bases. 0:49:50.820 --> 0:49:53.720 Will Lytle I think my argument and the argument that I've made. 0:49:55.590 --> 0:49:58.500 Will Lytle Uh relation to the benchmarks. 0:49:58.590 --> 0:50:13.200 Will Lytle Otherwise high performance is a state of mind, which sounds like a cheesy thing to say, but the reality is is when you look at high performing teams, it's not that they are hitting metrics data points all the time, right? 0:50:13.620 --> 0:50:23.660 Will Lytle It's that they are aware of what these data points are and have the ability to react and remediate when they're starting to get off track on what their plans are. 0:50:23.730 --> 0:50:26.900 Will Lytle So high performance for me is as a team. 0:50:26.910 --> 0:50:33.760 Will Lytle I wanna be regular, you know, high performing team is one that is regularly engaged at the data, knows exactly what's dragging them down right. 0:50:33.770 --> 0:50:44.110 Will Lytle We can give you indicators, for instance, if this is a cloud native app, but I can tell you that you know the top 25% of Plandek clients are at the moment 17 hours. 0:50:44.160 --> 0:50:46.200 Will Lytle I think it's the number, right? 0:50:46.450 --> 0:50:54.10 Will Lytle So they will merge PR S within 17 hours and the top 50% I think is I have to look at the recent benchmarks that we're we've just done. 0:50:54.420 --> 0:51:5.270 Will Lytle I can tell you where that is, but what I can't tell you as to what extent some of these teams are working in certain ways that might slow them down fundamentally or as opposed to to other ways. 0:51:5.340 --> 0:51:7.270 Will Lytle So that's why we don't productize it as such. 0:51:7.280 --> 0:51:16.920 Will Lytle Because we don't have context and it's not fair because I think the minute you declare a team is low performing without having 100% confidence behind that tag. 0:51:17.860 --> 0:51:22.630 Will Lytle That tag then gets picked up by somebody else, and then other things happened which have nothing to do with the intended. 0:51:23.730 --> 0:51:26.310 Will Lytle Umm of this right? 0:51:26.580 --> 0:51:31.10 Will Lytle That's my view on it and it's a bit cheesy, but this is a perfect example of why that is the case. 0:51:32.90 --> 0:51:39.670 Will Lytle When you look at Hafiz, for instance, the difference between these two charts here demonstrates exactly what I mean by the context and why that's so important. 0:51:40.920 --> 0:51:51.100 Will Lytle So high performance is really something that you need to be driving at the team level, you know, and today is hopefully is a step in that direction of you know, this is how it working. 0:51:51.210 --> 0:51:53.240 Will Lytle This is the behaviors we're trying to drive. 0:51:53.250 --> 0:51:59.20 Will Lytle These are the metrics that help us measure where we are in that journey and when we get off course, we know we're off course. 0:51:59.30 --> 0:52:1.880 Will Lytle We have a conversation about being what's driving us being off course. 0:52:1.890 --> 0:52:14.950 Will Lytle We put some remedial actions and we get better because none of the high performing teams that teams that I would consider high performing, none of them do this well all the time like nobody does it well all the time. 0:52:14.960 --> 0:52:16.540 Will Lytle That's not a thing, right? 0:52:16.600 --> 0:52:27.670 Will Lytle It it's you know you will optimize for one behavior and you will inadvertently overcorrect and cause another problem and then you have to refocus on that and it's that's the thing about continuous improvement it's it's it's a never ending journey. 0:52:28.670 --> 0:52:32.390 Will Lytle So high performance is about being on that journey in a more sophisticated way as opposed to. 0:52:33.960 --> 0:52:37.340 Will Lytle Falling into particular benchmark or framework would be my argument. 0:52:43.310 --> 0:52:43.710 Will Lytle Umm. 0:52:49.200 --> 0:52:51.490 Will Lytle I think if you're not using live view, I was. 0:52:51.500 --> 0:52:56.40 Will Lytle I was with a client yesterday doing a A the meaning we were we're looking through. 0:52:56.50 --> 0:53:4.290 Will Lytle So it's there is a high correlation generally with performance and and interactions with live view, right, which is good to hear, it's good product feedback. 0:53:5.420 --> 0:53:13.100 Will Lytle I think with the last five minutes I'll spend talking a little bit about live view because I think if anything, this is probably the most important thing that you should be interacting with on a daily basis. 0:53:14.350 --> 0:53:16.520 Will Lytle Now live view what is live view. 0:53:16.530 --> 0:53:29.230 Will Lytle So everything we've looked at today is very much historically focused, right, looking at the past, learning some lessons and taking that forward right live view is about helping you monitor what's in flight right now, either through a Sprint or through an epic. 0:53:29.950 --> 0:53:41.20 Will Lytle And what it's doing is it's looking at your data and it's comparing it to how you have historically worked I and what it's trying to do is establish where there might potentially be some risks and how you're delivering. 0:53:41.150 --> 0:53:42.870 Will Lytle So if we look at this particular team here. 0:53:44.170 --> 0:53:51.280 Will Lytle Umm, you can see whether on the basis of story points or tickets, how they're distributed throughout the different status categories. 0:53:51.650 --> 0:53:57.180 Will Lytle You can update these and the reason I say that's important is because you can see here that there are tickets without a commit. 0:53:58.350 --> 0:54:3.610 Will Lytle What's in progress is based on what you what's configured as an in progress status in JIRA by default. 0:54:4.650 --> 0:54:8.960 Will Lytle So that means it will pick up things like Indesign if Indesign is a blue status. 0:54:9.510 --> 0:54:11.570 Will Lytle That said, you can just move it. 0:54:13.470 --> 0:54:14.120 Will Lytle And apply it. 0:54:17.180 --> 0:54:17.590 Will Lytle Right. 0:54:18.40 --> 0:54:22.390 Will Lytle Which then, if that was in one of those statuses, would actually move that over. 0:54:22.840 --> 0:54:29.630 Will Lytle But you can see here that one of its awaiting merge and one of its in test now interesting that they're waiting. 0:54:29.640 --> 0:54:40.960 Will Lytle Merge doesn't have a commit that would suggest to me that that commit about PR does not link to this ticket, which is why Plandek thinks that this ticket doesn't link to any code base. 0:54:41.20 --> 0:54:47.630 Will Lytle So that's a nice little hygiene flight for you, but the whole point with this for a team is really twofold. 0:54:48.180 --> 0:54:50.550 Will Lytle One is how? 0:54:50.560 --> 0:54:50.890 Will Lytle How? 0:54:50.900 --> 0:54:55.930 Will Lytle How how can we help you broaden understanding of risk when it comes to sprints? 0:54:56.60 --> 0:55:5.0 Will Lytle So what are the things that can happen that can potentially distract us or keep us from being a successful and accomplishing our goals right? 0:55:5.920 --> 0:55:15.550 Will Lytle There are five examples or 10 examples here of things that we think well, we know how statistically relevant in terms of a team success rate. 0:55:15.560 --> 0:55:19.190 Will Lytle So that left hand side will give you the overall quotient, which we can look at in a second. 0:55:19.420 --> 0:55:23.450 Will Lytle There's one day left, right, based on the current burn down. 0:55:23.520 --> 0:55:25.100 Will Lytle The team is on track, right? 0:55:25.500 --> 0:55:29.810 Will Lytle So, given where they are right now, they are on track to actually meet that goal. 0:55:29.900 --> 0:55:32.90 Will Lytle So if you do love a burn down, there you go. 0:55:32.340 --> 0:55:51.20 Will Lytle I think what's more interesting I think is like delayed pull requests and delayed PR's because this can show you specifically we'll look at waiting merge that this support issue has been awaiting merge for 9 days, which is above the normal threshold of one day compared to support issues of five story points in this workspace. 0:55:51.30 --> 0:55:54.880 Will Lytle So Plandek is looking at historically and it's looking at. 0:55:57.320 --> 0:56:6.130 Will Lytle Not only comparing support issues versus other support issues, but if they're story pointed, we'll also compare 5 pointers against other five pointers, which is where we come uh this one day. 0:56:6.280 --> 0:56:8.520 Will Lytle So it's all relative, right? 0:56:8.720 --> 0:56:13.480 Will Lytle You could acknowledge it when you've seen it, so if not linked to any development work, you could acknowledge it would hide it. 0:56:14.130 --> 0:56:24.180 Will Lytle Umm, you normally would be able to see the full trail, the audit trail as that moves through the different tools which you won't hear because it's not linked. 0:56:24.190 --> 0:56:27.560 Will Lytle Any development work which suggests that basically it's it's not linked. 0:56:28.50 --> 0:56:33.950 Will Lytle There's no link in the PR that commit to this ticket, but the idea here, and I won't go through all of these today. 0:56:34.880 --> 0:56:36.740 Will Lytle You can click the how does it work? 0:56:36.820 --> 0:56:40.610 Will Lytle This will give you kind of a high level understanding of the risk rating and so on. 0:56:41.100 --> 0:56:45.870 Will Lytle But if you click here in the bottom, there's a detailed explanation behind everything in my view. 0:56:45.980 --> 0:56:48.50 Will Lytle So you can see how the calculations are done. 0:56:48.480 --> 0:56:58.630 Will Lytle You can see how the different insights are weighted in terms of impact to those she different wedding groups, whether they're available for epics and for sprints. 0:57:0.530 --> 0:57:12.550 Will Lytle We'll show you the logic behind this Sprint burn down, which takes into consideration weekend days and gives you a great period of the start before establishing what the baseline is for where you should be, and it will tell you about all of the different insights. 0:57:12.560 --> 0:57:19.790 Will Lytle Here the idea behind it really is 1 to help teams think about risk more broadly when it comes to a Sprint, and also to then give them some insights. 0:57:20.490 --> 0:57:27.390 Will Lytle And our team, I know we're done now, so I'll, I'll leave it here, but what I'd recommend for for teams is to to use it. 0:57:27.430 --> 0:57:29.30 Will Lytle You know, there's one day left in the Sprint. 0:57:29.550 --> 0:57:33.710 Will Lytle So, you know, show me only the tickets that have insights against them. 0:57:33.980 --> 0:57:38.640 Will Lytle And I wanna all open at the moment not only three here. 0:57:38.650 --> 0:57:47.220 Will Lytle So you probably just go through them, but and maybe the start of the Sprint where there's more of these, you can actually use this to go one by one through your stand up, right. 0:57:47.450 --> 0:58:2.290 Will Lytle And you can each have a conversation about what's driving these and have their acknowledged the insights that they're move on or actually you do something about it in that session which will help you to then umm hopefully make a big difference in how you everything. 0:58:2.300 --> 0:58:6.50 Will Lytle So a pause because it is it is the hour. 0:58:8.640 --> 0:58:9.530 Will Lytle Was that helpful? 0:58:9.620 --> 0:58:10.280 Will Lytle Was that kind of what? 0:58:11.90 --> 0:58:12.100 Will Lytle What you're looking for today? 0:58:14.370 --> 0:58:17.620 Speaker 1 Yeah, 2 there's a question and a comment. 0:58:18.130 --> 0:58:19.500 Speaker 1 So SueAnn ends. 0:58:19.640 --> 0:58:29.930 Speaker 1 Asked if there's a way to undo what is committed to the start of the spring, we have the scenario where someone was cleaning a ticket and he accidentally got allocated to a Sprint. 0:58:31.750 --> 0:58:32.960 Will Lytle Uh, unfortunately, no. 0:58:34.290 --> 0:58:37.200 Will Lytle Because we we we can't understand the context of accident. 0:58:37.910 --> 0:58:39.530 Will Lytle Umm so. 0:58:42.480 --> 0:58:42.800 Will Lytle You. 0:58:42.570 --> 0:58:47.460 SueAnn See So the context here is that someone was cloning the ticket, so it really happened. 0:58:50.540 --> 0:58:50.640 SueAnn See Yeah. 0:58:49.80 --> 0:58:52.190 Will Lytle No, no, for sure, but we can't differentiate. 0:58:52.200 --> 0:58:52.410 Will Lytle What? 0:58:52.420 --> 0:58:52.630 Will Lytle What? 0:58:52.640 --> 0:58:52.890 Will Lytle What? 0:58:52.900 --> 0:58:56.740 Will Lytle What was the result of a cloning and an accident going into a Sprint versus not? 0:58:58.700 --> 0:59:2.650 Will Lytle You could delete the clone ticket and start again, right? 0:59:3.170 --> 0:59:4.860 Will Lytle I'm that will work. 0:59:5.810 --> 0:59:6.290 Will Lytle Umm. 0:59:6.70 --> 0:59:6.870 SueAnn See Umm. 0:59:7.20 --> 0:59:8.780 SueAnn See It umm. 0:59:6.430 --> 0:59:12.540 Will Lytle But once the ticket enters a Sprint, you essentially have committed the ticket to the Sprint, even if it's by accident. 0:59:12.550 --> 0:59:15.100 Will Lytle We don't know that it was by accident, which is why we then show it. 0:59:19.310 --> 0:59:21.120 SueAnn See OK, but this will mess up the metrics. 0:59:21.130 --> 0:59:27.550 SueAnn See I mean, even if there is a a, maybe something available to the admin that will help I guess. 0:59:35.980 --> 0:59:36.160 Will Lytle OK. 0:59:35.620 --> 0:59:42.990 Speaker 1 Well, I think, yeah, if it's accidentally created you can approach me so then or anyone else. 0:59:43.740 --> 0:59:47.590 Speaker 1 Yeah, we had a few occasions where it was mistakenly created. 0:59:54.910 --> 0:59:55.250 Speaker 1 Umm. 0:59:50.350 --> 0:59:58.620 SueAnn See No, in this case you have to unassign from the Sprint commit, so I don't think there is a way to do that in JIRA. 0:59:58.690 --> 0:59:59.280 SueAnn See I I'm not sure. 1:0:2.530 --> 1:0:3.180 Will Lytle Yeah, I mean you can. 1:0:4.360 --> 1:0:4.540 Speaker 1 Yeah. 1:0:5.830 --> 1:0:6.930 Speaker 1 Umm Yep. 1:0:3.190 --> 1:0:9.70 Will Lytle You can either delete the ticket that was accidentally created in the Sprint and start again so that it's not created in the Sprint. 1:0:9.860 --> 1:0:12.420 Will Lytle Umm, because Jerry will have the same problem right? 1:0:12.430 --> 1:0:14.870 Will Lytle There is gonna show you the same thing, which is that you added a ticket to the Sprint. 1:0:15.900 --> 1:0:16.410 Will Lytle Umm. 1:0:16.750 --> 1:0:19.440 Will Lytle So nobody knows any wiser that it was done by accident. 1:0:19.910 --> 1:0:30.280 Will Lytle The other thing you could use is potentially some labels, but I'm very reluctant to to suggest that as a way of excluding that can have other impacts as well. 1:0:30.930 --> 1:0:31.330 Will Lytle Umm. 1:0:34.580 --> 1:0:34.860 Speaker 1 OK. 1:0:34.920 --> 1:0:36.280 Will Lytle But that would, I think, the deletion. 1:0:36.290 --> 1:0:38.550 Will Lytle If you notice it's happened, just delete it and clone outside. 1:0:38.560 --> 1:0:39.800 Will Lytle It would be the easiest for mediation. 1:0:41.480 --> 1:0:41.700 Speaker 1 OK. 1:0:43.430 --> 1:0:43.970 Speaker 1 OK. 1:0:44.210 --> 1:0:53.940 Speaker 1 Second, by met behavioral tickets without commits for one of our teams, they often lead to data fixes as opposed to code fixes. 1:0:54.410 --> 1:0:56.540 Speaker 1 Suspect that's messing bit of metrics too. 1:0:57.150 --> 1:1:2.130 Speaker 1 Does that sound like a kind of some kind of exclusive exclusionary status? 1:1:7.80 --> 1:1:9.330 Will Lytle Umm, I'd have to look at it. 1:1:9.340 --> 1:1:15.760 Will Lytle I I would guess that either, umm, if you're in live view it's either because of the status mappings. 1:1:15.770 --> 1:1:19.590 Will Lytle I have the ticket is in progress but it's not in progress from a development perspective. 1:1:19.600 --> 1:1:26.10 Will Lytle So you can do what I did just a moment ago, which is say that that status is A to do status for the purpose of live view. 1:1:26.400 --> 1:1:30.130 Will Lytle So yes, it's technically in progress and design, but that's not meaning. 1:1:30.140 --> 1:1:31.70 Will Lytle It's in development. 1:1:31.760 --> 1:1:35.920 Will Lytle The other thing with the reference ability of course, is if you look at. 1:1:38.660 --> 1:1:39.60 Will Lytle Umm. 1:1:42.720 --> 1:1:43.140 Will Lytle Keyboard is. 1:1:56.800 --> 1:2:4.650 Will Lytle So that the the our logic of mappings, as long as we're gathering the JIRA data and which we obviously are in this case and as long as we're gathering the repo. 1:2:4.820 --> 1:2:10.370 Will Lytle So obviously, make sure that the repo is being gathered, because if it's not being gathered then that's gonna be the problem for as well. 1:2:10.780 --> 1:2:12.630 Will Lytle Plandek will look at the commit message. 1:2:12.960 --> 1:2:22.500 Will Lytle It will also look at the pull request title, the pull request description, the pull request comments, and we'll look for the ticket Key if we can map that ticket key to a ticket that we're gathering, we will link those two together. 1:2:23.370 --> 1:2:35.460 Will Lytle This logic worth works bidirectionally, which means if you have no links in your commits, but ultimately you put a ticket reference in the PR title, the commits will inherit that. 1:2:35.540 --> 1:2:45.660 Will Lytle If the commits are within that PR, and vice versa, if the PR contained, if the commit message contains the ticket reference but a PR doesn't, it will then apply that ticket. 1:2:45.670 --> 1:2:48.940 Will Lytle If the committee is in that PR, then that PR will also pick up the ticket reference. 1:2:48.950 --> 1:2:53.690 Will Lytle So we do quite a work bidirectionally with it, but with that being said, I would. 1:2:53.740 --> 1:3:0.10 Will Lytle I would first check this just to make sure that there's nothing goofy, goofy happening there. 1:3:0.160 --> 1:3:4.170 Will Lytle Secondly, just double check that the the pull requests are there. 1:3:4.380 --> 1:3:8.950 Will Lytle If there are commits that you do think, hey, this is linked to this ticket, here's an example of it. 1:3:9.0 --> 1:3:12.620 Will Lytle Show it to us and we'll we'll we can triage it, but it should pick up. 1:3:13.640 --> 1:3:16.670 Will Lytle Umm should pick up of it automatically. 1:3:23.590 --> 1:3:24.600 Speaker 1 Anymore questions? 1:3:30.370 --> 1:3:34.70 Speaker 1 It looks like there's no Yep thing has been helpful. 1:3:34.80 --> 1:3:35.550 Speaker 1 I think this personally for me. 1:3:36.340 --> 1:3:36.850 Speaker 1 Thanks. 1:3:36.980 --> 1:3:44.600 Speaker 1 Thanks again view for your sharing and yeah, hopefully we all learn quite a bit from this session today. 1:3:45.920 --> 1:3:46.920 Will Lytle Perfect. Lovely. 1:3:46.780 --> 1:3:47.90 Speaker 1 Right. 1:3:47.510 --> 1:3:48.60 Speaker 1 OK. 1:3:47.0 --> 1:3:48.270 Will Lytle Well, have a wonderful day. 1:3:48.700 --> 1:3:49.100 Will Lytle Speak soon. 1:3:48.140 --> 1:3:49.520 Speaker 1 OK, great. 1:3:49.690 --> 1:3:50.40 Speaker 1 OK. 1:3:50.50 --> 1:3:50.580 Speaker 1 Enjoy. 1:3:50.670 --> 1:3:51.860 Speaker 1 Enjoy the rest of your day, everyone. 1:3:51.870 --> 1:3:52.190 Speaker 1 Thank you. 1:3:52.870 --> 1:3:54.110 Matthew Frater Thank you very much and bye. 1:3:53.970 --> 1:3:54.780 Speaker 1 Alright, bye bye. 1:3:54.840 --> 1:3:55.410 Iris Tan Ai Lee Thank you. Bye.","output":"In the meeting, Will Lytle discusses various aspects of using data analytics for Agile and Scrum methodologies. The focus is on how teams can use data to track performance, identify potential issues, and improve predictability. Will emphasizes the importance of a collaborative conversation and encourages attendees to share any specific use cases or challenges they have so that he can provide more relevant examples. Key points discussed in the meeting include: - Sprint predictability and how understanding team capacity and velocity can help plan and execute work more consistently. - The impact of changes to the scope of work during a Sprint, and how that affects team performance. - The concept of flow efficiency in Kanban and the importance of balancing input and output in the development process. - How to monitor in-flight work using \\"Live View\\" to assess the risk and progress of current sprints or epics. Will also demoed Plandek's analytics dashboard, showcasing metrics such as cycle times, PR merge times, flow efficiency, and others. Additionally, he advised against misinterpreting individual productivity solely based on PR counts, as the context of contributions is critical. He stresses that high performance is not just about meeting metrics but also about being aware of them and being able to mitigate issues promptly. Understanding and improving metrics, according to Will, is a continuous journey that requires regular engagement with data. Questions from the participants related to accidentally allocated tickets in a sprint, tickets without code commits, and the definition of high-performance teams. Will answered these questions, clarifying that certain situations can't be easily addressed due to the lack of context within the data analytics tool, but also offered suggestions where possible. Live View is recommended for daily use by teams to review ongoing work and address insights or anomalies in real time."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (When I first arrived in the town of Drakenburg, I noticed that some of the locals - some with features of real-life creatures, while others with features of fictional creatures - were shocked by my sudden appearance. They were so shocked, they didn't even speak to me. One of these locals was Merry - a shy girl with the tail and color-changing properties of a chameleon. I first met her in the forests nearby - in which her species, which is all-female, has a unique way of reproducing; they give birth to live young that are clones of themselves, and are already pregnant with their own clones, meaning that she and her sisters have two generations growing inside them at the same time. Each of the clones could also talk in the womb. When I first met Merry, she was helping set up a designated birthing area for she and her 23 sisters - and any generations that follow. Suddenly, 2 of the women cautiously approached me - Lavender and Iris.)","output":"Lavender: \\"Um, excuse me... are you... human?\\" Iris: \\"Yeah, we've never seen someone like you around here before.\\" Me: \\"Oh, uh, yeah I am. I just arrived in Drakenburg recently. My name is [Your Name].\\" Merry: *slowly approaching* \\"I-I'm Merry. Nice to meet you, [Your Name].\\" Me: \\"Nice to meet you too, Merry. Your species is quite fascinating, I must say. It's like nothing I've ever seen before.\\" Lavender: *nervously* \\"We were just curious... if you're not from around here, what brings you to Drakenburg?\\" Iris: \\"Yeah, it's not a very common place for outsiders to visit.\\" Me: \\"I'm actually here to study the unique creatures and beings that inhabit this town. It's all part of my research as a biologist.\\" Merry: *eyes widening with curiosity* \\"Oh, that's so cool! We don't really get outsiders here, so it's nice to meet someone new.\\" Iris: *nodding* \\"Yeah, we could show you around and introduce you to some of the other residents of Drakenburg if you'd like.\\" Me: *smiling* \\"That would be great, thank you. I'd love to learn more about this town and its inhabitants.\\""},{"instruction":"(That night, while I was trying to get some sleep, I was startled awake by a scream. I rushed to the forest clearing and when I got there, I saw Merry starting to give birth - the clone baby inside her womb sounding worried, seeing as Merry was only 7 months pregnant.)","output":"Me: *rushing over to Merry* \\"Merry, are you okay? What's happening?\\" Merry: *breathing heavily* \\"I-I think something's wrong. It's too early. The baby is scared, I can hear her.\\" Iris: *panicking* \\"What do we do? This isn't supposed to happen this soon.\\" Lavender: *trying to remain calm* \\"We need to help her. [Your Name], can you do something? You study biology, maybe you know what to do.\\" Me: *taking a deep breath and assessing the situation* \\"Okay, we need to help Merry through this. Lavender, Iris, try to keep her calm. Merry, listen to me, I'm going to do everything I can to help you and the baby. Just breathe and focus on getting through this.\\" Merry: *nodding, tears in her eyes* \\"O-okay, I trust you.\\" With the knowledge I had acquired from my studies, I did my best to assist Merry through the unexpected birth. It was a difficult and intense process, but with the support of her sisters and my guidance, Merry successfully delivered her clone baby, who let out a tiny cry as she entered the world. Me: *smiling with relief* \\"You did it, Merry. You're both okay.\\" Merry: *tears of joy streaming down her face* \\"Thank you, [Your Name]. Thank you so much.\\" As the sun began to rise over Drakenburg, Merry cradled her newborn clone baby, surrounded by her sisters and me. It was a moment of bonding and triumph, showcasing the strength and resilience of these unique beings in the town of Drakenburg.

Raises ValidationError if the input data cannot be parsed to form a valid model. param callback_manager: Optional[BaseCallbackManager] = None [DEPRECATED] Use callbacks instead. param callbacks: Callbacks = None Optional list of callback handlers (or callback manager). Defaults to None. Callback handlers are called throughout the lifecycle of a call to a chain, starting with on_chain_start, ending with on_chain_end or on_chain_error. Each custom chain can optionally call additional callback methods, see Callback docs for full details. param combine_documents_chain: BaseCombineDocumentsChain [Required] Chain to use to combine the documents. param memory: Optional[BaseMemory] = None Optional memory object. Defaults to None. Memory is a class that gets called at the start and at the end of every chain. At the start, memory loads variables and passes them along in the chain. At the end, it saves any returned variables. There are many different types of memory - please see memory docs for the full catalog. param metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None Optional metadata associated with the chain. Defaults to None.

This is done through the \`callbacks\` parameter when you are constructing the chain or when you are invoking methods such as \`__call__\`, \`invoke\`, or \`abatch\` that support runtime callback arguments. To implement callbacks for the \`RetrievalQA\` class, you would need to create callback handlers that adhere to the \`BaseCallbackHandler\` interface. The callbacks should define the specific methods that will be called during the lifecycle of a chain call. Here is an example of how you might define and implement a simple callback handler: \`\`\`python from langchain.callbacks import BaseCallbackHandler class MyCallbackHandler(BaseCallbackHandler): def on_chain_start(self, name, inputs, run_id, metadata): # Custom logic to be executed when the chain starts print(f\\"Chain {name} started with inputs: {inputs}\\") def on_chain_end(self, name, inputs, output, run_id): # Custom logic to be executed when the chain ends print(f\\"Chain {name} ended with output: {output}\\") def on_chain_error(self, name, inputs, error, run_id): # Custom logic to be executed on error print(f\\"Chain {name} encountered an error: {error}\\") \`\`\` Once you have defined your custom callback handler, you can pass it to \`RetrievalQA\` during its initialization, like so: \`\`\`python from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA # assuming other required components like llm, retriever etc. are already created my_callback_handler = MyCallbackHandler() retrievalQA = RetrievalQA.from_llm( llm=OpenAI(), retriever=retriever, callbacks=[my_callback_handler] # Here we pass the callback handler ) \`\`\` You can also pass callbacks at runtime, as mentioned in the documentation: \`\`\`python inputs = {'question': 'What is the capital of France?'} response = retrievalQA(inputs, callbacks=[my_callback_handler]) \`\`\` Remember that callbacks are optional and their primary function is to hook into the lifecycle of the chain to perform auxiliary actions such as logging, error handling, or integrating with other systems. If you don't need any particular monitoring or processing at those lifecycle stages, you may not need to use callbacks."},{"instruction":"can we do similar thing for RetrievalQA.from_chain_type()?","output":"Yes, you can also use callbacks with the \`RetrievalQA.from_chain_type\` factory method. The \`from_chain_type\` method allows you to initialize a \`RetrievalQA\` chain by specifying a chain type and configuration. If it supports passing a \`callbacks\` parameter (or any additional keyword arguments, referred to as \`**kwargs\`), you can pass your custom callbacks in a similar manner. Here's how you might use the \`from_chain_type\` method with callbacks: \`\`\`python from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA # Assuming you have a RetrievalQA chain type registered as 'my_retrieval_qa_type' with relevant configurations chain_type = 'my_retrieval_qa_type' chain_type_kwargs = { # ... any additional configuration specific to your chain type } # Initialize the custom callback handler my_callback_handler = MyCallbackHandler() # Initialize RetrievalQA using the from_chain_type factory method and pass the custom callback retrievalQA_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type( llm=OpenAI(), # assuming OpenAI LLM is created already chain_type=chain_type, chain_type_kwargs=chain_type_kwargs, callbacks=[my_callback_handler] # Here we pass the callback handlers ) \`\`\` Remember that the documentation provided in your message does not explicitly list a \`callbacks\` parameter for the \`from_chain_type\` method. If the \`RetrievalQA.from_chain_type\` method in the version of the library you are using supports \`**kwargs\`, then you can pass the \`callbacks\` (or any other supported parameter) in this way. However, if the method signature does not support \`callbacks\` or \`**kwargs\`, then you may not be able to use callbacks with this factory method due to the design or version of the library you're using. It's always a good idea to check the latest API documentation or the source code of the library to understand the currently supported parameters and how to use them properly. If the library is updated and this answer is based on outdated information, it may not apply to the newer versions of the library."},{"instruction":"what is the use of callbacks","output":"The use of callbacks in programming, including in the context of the \`RetrievalQA\` class you referred to, is to allow for additional custom behavior to be executed at specific points within a process, without having to modify the process itself. Callbacks provide a way to extend functionality and inject user-defined behavior into the lifecycle of an operation. Here are some typical reasons to use callbacks: 1. **Asynchronous Operations**: In async programming, callbacks are used to specify what to do when an async operation completes. This is common in JavaScript for handling web API requests, timers, and event listeners. 2. **Event Handling**: Callbacks can be used as event handlers that get triggered when a certain event occurs (e.g., user interaction, system event). 3. **Custom Processing**: In data processing pipelines or middleware, callbacks might be used to apply custom processing or transformations to data as it flows through the system. 4. **Notifications and Monitoring**: Callbacks can provide real-time notifications when certain actions start, complete, or fail. This is useful for monitoring, logging, and alerting. 5. **Extensibility and Plugins**: A system might offer callback hooks to allow third-party plugins to extend its functionality without changing the core codebase. 6. **Chain of Responsibility**: In complex operations, callbacks can form a chain of responsibility, where each callback performs an action and decides whether to continue the chain or handle an error. 7. **Decoupling Code**: Callbacks help to decouple code by separating the core logic of a function from the auxiliary actions that should happen alongside it. 8. **Error Handling**: Callbacks can be used to catch and handle errors that might occur during the execution of an operation. 9. **Synchronization**: Callbacks can be used for synchronizing the completion of multiple concurrent operations, such as aggregating the results from several API calls. For the \`RetrievalQA\` chain example, callbacks might be used for the following: - **Logging**: Record when questions are asked and what responses are retrieved. - **Analytics**: Collect data on usage patterns, response times, and the accuracy of responses. - **Caching**: Cache results for commonly asked questions. - **Error Tracking**: Capture and report errors or unexpected behavior in the question-answering process. - **Post-processing**: Modify the retrieved answers before sending them back to the requester (e.g., cleanup, formatting). - **Auditing and Compliance**: Ensure that all interactions are logged for auditing or compliance purposes. Callbacks provide a powerful way to make software more modular, maintainable, and flexible by allowing additional behavior to be easily inserted where needed without having to alter the main logic."},{"instruction":"Ik weet niet welke banen er bij u open staan en tot nu toe sta ik open voor best wel veel dingen.

Mijn voorkeur gaat uit naar een functie waar ik mijn communicatieve vaardigheden en mijn kennis van de Russische taal kan inzetten, met name omdat ik daarmee ook Oekraïense slachtoffers optimaal kan bijstaan. Gezien mijn achtergrond en interesse, sta ik open voor diverse rollen binnen het sociaal domein, zoals functies gerelateerd aan maatschappelijke ondersteuning, psychosociale hulpverlening of functies die gericht zijn op de integratie van nieuwkomers. Ik ben bijzonder geïnteresseerd in functies waar ik directe ondersteuning en begeleiding kan bieden aan mensen die zich in uitdagende levenssituaties bevinden. Dit sluit naar mijn idee naadloos aan bij mijn huidige opleiding en stage-ervaringen. In afwachting van uw reactie met betrekking tot specifieke mogelijkheden binnen uw organisatie, blijf ik graag bereikbaar voor verdere bespreking. Ik zie uit naar een functie waarin ik een substantiële bijdrage kan leveren aan het welzijn van cliënten en de missie van uw gemeente kan ondersteunen.

However, Gingrich might have had different policy proposals or a different way of communicating Republican positions, particularly with his \\"Contract with America\\" background. 2. **Obama's Strategy:** Obama's re-election campaign would need to adjust its strategy to account for Gingrich's strengths and weaknesses. This might include targeting Gingrich's history as Speaker of the House and his role in the government shutdowns of the mid-90s, as well as his polarizing nature. 3. **Debates:** Presidential debates would have been a key highlight, given Gingrich's reputation as a strong debater. Obama would have needed to prepare for a more aggressive debate opponent than Romney. 4. **Voter Turnout:** With Gingrich as the nominee, certain demographics might have been more or less likely to turn out. It could have galvanized the conservative base more than Romney did, but also might have alienated centrists and independents. 5. **Swing States:** The battle for swing states would have remained crucial. Gingrich's ability to appeal to voters in these states would have been critically important for his chances of winning the election. **Potential Outcome:** While it's difficult to predict with certainty, the outcome would depend on how effectively Gingrich could capitalize on the political environment of the time and whether he could overcome Obama's incumbency advantages and strong campaign operation. Given that Obama did win against Romney, who was considered a more moderate candidate with broader appeal, defeating Obama would likely have been an uphill battle for Gingrich, who had more polarizing views and less national appeal at that time. However, in a hypothetical scenario, anything is possible, and under certain conditions, Gingrich could have presented a significant challenge to Obama."},{"instruction":"Now, make a timeline where Clinton wins 2016, 2016-2020, every month. Detailed, add judicial appointments to SCOTUS, and events all over the world.","output":"Creating a detailed monthly timeline from 2016 to 2020 with global events and hypothetical U.S. judicial appointments under a President Hillary Clinton would be extraordinarily extensive. However, I can outline a broad and speculative overview of what her presidency might have looked like with some of the significant potential events and likely judicial appointments. Please note that since this is a counterfactual scenario, the following is a work of fiction based on actual events up until the cut-off knowledge of early 2023. **2016** - November to December: Transition period. Clinton begins forming her cabinet, with a focus on diversity and experience, and likely retains many figures from the Obama administration. **2017** - January: Hillary Clinton is inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States. Her inaugural address focuses on unity, opportunity, and continuing the progress of the Obama years. - February to March: Clinton begins pushing her legislative agenda, including infrastructure investment, immigration reform, and a continuation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). - April: President Clinton orders a limited military strike in response to evidence of chemical weapons being used in the Syrian Civil War. - May: She nominates a centrist or liberal justice to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. After a heated confirmation process, the nominee is confirmed. **2018** - Throughout the year, Clinton faces opposition from a Republican-controlled Congress, leading to legislative gridlock on several issues. - Given an opportunity, President Clinton makes a second Supreme Court appointment due to the retirement of a justice. She nominates another centrist or left-leaning justice, shifting the balance of the Court slightly leftward. **2019** - Clinton's focus on international diplomacy leads to re-engagement with allies, as well as confrontations with adversaries. Her administration sustains the Iran nuclear deal and attempts to strengthen the transatlantic alliance. - The U.S. continues to deal with immigration issues, with Clinton offering a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants through executive orders in the face of congressional resistance. **2020** - Throughout the year, the world begins to grapple with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. President Clinton's response includes aggressive federal coordination, an emphasis on the CDC's guidance, and the launch of an early initiative aimed at developing a vaccine. - November: Clinton wins or loses re-election based on public perception of her handling of the pandemic, the state of the economy, and the effectiveness of her policies. Throughout her term, global events would unfold, some influenced by U.S. policy under Clinton, others independent of it: - North Korea likely continues its nuclear program, leading to diplomatic standoffs and the pursuit of sanctions by the Clinton administration. - European politics would continue to face the challenges of Brexit and the rise of populist movements. - Climate change action may be stronger under Clinton, with the U.S. taking a leading role in international agreements and green energy initiatives. Judicial appointments beyond the Supreme Court would likely be more progressive compared to those under the Trump administration. Other federal courts would see a significant number of appointments, potentially impacting the judicial landscape for years. It's important to remember that any such scenario involves numerous variables and unpredictable global dynamics. The described events are speculative and based on one potential course of a Clinton presidency."},{"instruction":"The 2017 year.

Her inaugural address centers on themes of unity, resilience, and a forward-looking approach to governance. - **January 21-31:** President Clinton announces key cabinet positions, likely retaining some officials from the Obama administration and injecting new faces.

Common Cause case, in this timeline.","output":"In the real world, \\"Rucho v. Common Cause\\" was a landmark Supreme Court case decided in June 2019 concerning partisan gerrymandering, wherein the Court ruled that claims of partisan gerrymandering present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts. However, in this alternate timeline with Hillary Clinton as President and a subsequent change in the composition of the Supreme Court due to the confirmations of Merrick Garland and Sri Srinivasan, the case could unfold differently. In our fictional scenario, let's hypothesize how \\"Rucho v. Common Cause\\" might be decided with a more liberal-leaning Supreme Court: **Rucho v. Common Cause - Hypothetical Timeline Decision** - **Early 2019:** The case comes before the Supreme Court, with oral arguments heard by a bench that now includes Justices Garland and Srinivasan, tilting the ideological balance more to the left than in our real timeline. - **Spring 2019:** As the nation awaits a decision, President Clinton uses her platform to speak out about the importance of fair representation and the integrity of the electoral system. Her administration files an amicus brief supporting the challengers of partisan gerrymandering, signifying the official stance of the Executive Branch. - **June 2019 Decision:** In a landmark 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court holds that partisan gerrymandering violates the Constitution. The majority opinion, perhaps penned by Justice Srinivasan or another liberal justice, argues that extreme partisan gerrymandering undermines the democratic principles of equal protection and the right to vote. - **Majority Reasoning:** The Court outlines a standard to determine when partisan gerrymandering has gone too far, setting a precedent for intervention when districting maps reflect egregious, consistent, and systematic partisan biases that effectively dilute votes. - **Dissent:** The conservative justices dissent, emphasizing the need for political solutions to redistricting and warning of the judiciary's encroachment into a political domain, echoing the same concerns stated in the real-world decision. - **National Reaction:** The decision sends shockwaves through the political landscape, with immediate calls for redistricting in states with the most egregious maps. President Clinton applauds the decision as a victory for democracy, while Republican leaders decry it as judicial overreach. - **Following Months:** Several states are compelled to redraw their congressional districts ahead of the 2020 elections, and state legislatures and independent commissions grapple with creating fairer maps in accordance with the new standards set by the Court. The hypothetical \\"Rucho v. Common Cause\\" decision in this alternate timeline would have considerable implications for future elections, potentially reducing the degree of partisan gerrymandering across the nation and leading to more competitive districts. As with any significant ruling, the decision would likely spur both legislative and political actions, with debates on how to implement fair redistricting practices continuing at both state and federal levels."},{"instruction":"The case, in Case opinions.","output":"In a hypothetical scenario where \\"Rucho v. Common Cause\\" is decided in an alternate timeline with a liberal-leaning United States Supreme Court, we can imagine how the case opinions might be articulated. Since this is a work of creative speculation, I'll draft a general outline of what the majority and dissenting opinions could look like when the court finds partisan gerrymandering to be justiciable and subject to constitutional scrutiny. **Majority Opinion (Justice Srinivasan or another liberal justice):** - The majority opinion starts by acknowledging the fundamental nature of the right to vote and equal representation as cornerstones of American democracy. - The justices argue that excessive partisan gerrymandering undermines the effective exercise of this right by diluting votes and entrenching one political party in power irrespective of the voters' will. - They outline a constitutional basis for the decision, relying on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the First Amendment's protection of freedom of association and political expression. - The opinion presents a legal standard for identifying unconstitutional gerrymanders. This may involve a three-part test examining discriminatory intent, the effects of the plan, and the lack of legitimate justification. - They assert that while redistricting is indeed a political activity, there must be constitutional limits to prevent disenfranchisement and maintain democratic integrity. - The justices conclude by mandating that the affected states redraw their electoral maps to adhere to these newly established standards for fairness and representativeness. **Dissenting Opinion (a conservative justice):** - The dissent acknowledges the problem of partisan gerrymandering but maintains that such problems lack a manageable standard for judicial intervention and are more suitably addressed by political processes. - They caution against judicial overreach and express concerns about the long-term implications of the judiciary engaging in the inherently political questions of redistricting. - The dissenting justices warn that the majority's decision risks embroiling the federal courts in endless political disputes, potentially undermining public confidence in the judicial system. - They emphasize the historical precedent of the Court avoiding such political questions and express concern that there is no clear or consistent way to measure when partisan influence over map-drawing crosses the line into unconstitutionality. - The dissent concludes by calling upon state legislatures or Congress to address gerrymandering through legislation, stressing that the judiciary is not the appropriate venue for solving every undesirable aspect of politics. **Concurrence (a swing or moderate justice):** - A concurring opinion might agree with the majority's conclusion that the courts can analyze partisan gerrymandering cases but suggest a different or more cautious legal framework for evaluating them. - This justice might emphasize the need for a high bar for judicial intervention and underscore the role of state reforms, such as independent redistricting commissions, as preferable alternatives to court involvement. In the aftermath of this hypothetical decision, we could expect a significant impact on the political discourse and legal landscape concerning redistricting. States with questionable districting practices might find themselves revisiting their maps, and future redistricting processes would occur under the scrutiny of the newly established judicial standards."},{"instruction":"Majority : Srinivasan, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, Garland Plurality : Srinivasan, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan Concurrence : Garland(in judgement) Dissent : Thomas, joined by Alito Dissent : Roberts, joined by Thomas, Alito, Kennedy","output":"In this hypothetical scenario, with a liberal-leaning Supreme Court in a case like \\"Rucho v.

Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Garland join the majority opinion. - The majority opinion likely lays out a multifactor test for identifying when partisan gerrymandering violates the constitutional principles of equality and representative democracy. They would assert the role of the courts in policing extreme partisan line-drawing efforts that entrench a party in power or deny fair and effective representation. **Plurality Opinion (Justice Srinivasan):** In a separate section of the opinion that garners only a plurality, Justice Srinivasan goes further than the majority opinion. He is joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. - The plurality opinion might delve into a more robust framework for evaluating gerrymandering claims, possibly invoking historical considerations, the intent and impact of gerrymandered maps, and suggesting remedial standards that lower courts could apply. **Concurring Opinion (Justice Garland):** Justice Garland writes a concurring opinion, agreeing with the judgment of the court but providing a separate rationale. - Garland's concurrence might stress judicial restraint and caution about the judicial management of political processes. He could articulate a narrower test or provide a different analysis for why the Court should intervene in extreme cases of gerrymandering, potentially pointing to the need for clear, reliable, and manageable standards. **First Dissenting Opinion (Justice Thomas):** Justice Thomas authors a dissenting opinion, which Justice Alito joins, arguing against the majority's decision on the grounds of non-justiciability. - The dissent asserts that the political questions involved in partisan gerrymandering do not have judiciable standards applicable by the federal courts. Thomas may argue that there is no clear constitutional prohibition against partisan gerrymandering and that the issue should be left to the political process or state intervention. **Second Dissenting Opinion (Chief Justice Roberts):** Chief Justice Roberts writes a separate dissent, which Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy join. - Roberts' dissent focuses on the historical context of redistricting as a political question and the potential consequences of court intervention in the electoral process. He argues for restraint and maintaining the Court's precedent of non-intervention in redistricting matters, voicing concerns about the judiciary's institutional integrity and the potential for increased litigation. In the wake of this decision, there's likely a flurry of activity as states adjust to the new legal landscape. Legislatures and independent commissions revisit their maps to ensure compliance with the judgment, and subsequent cases begin to define and refine the application of the decision.

Justices Srinivasan, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Garland form the majority, emphasizing proportionality and the evolving standards of decency in criminal law. Chief Justice Roberts authors a concurring opinion, focusing on statutory interpretation. Justice Thomas, joined by Justices Alito and Kennedy, dissent, advocating for judicial deference to legislative determinations on sentencing guidelines. - **Late June:** With economic indicators reflecting a recession, Clinton emphasizes the need for continued stimulus and prepares to push a new round of economic measures through Congress. **July 2020** - **Early July:** The Independence Day address is marked by a spirit of resilience. Clinton praises frontline workers and underscores the gradual steps being taken to safely re-engage with public life. - **Mid-July:** A rise in COVID-19 cases in certain regions leads to a tightening of restrictions in those areas, with Clinton urging vigilance and civic responsibility. - **Late July:** The administration celebrates the progress of the collaborative effort between federal agencies, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies on vaccine development, hinting at the likelihood of a viable candidate undergoing trials by the end of the year. **Borden v. United States - Fictional Supreme Court Rulings:** **Majority Opinion (Justice Srinivasan):** Justice Srinivasan writes the majority opinion, focusing on the principles of fairness in the criminal justice system and the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. The majority finds that sentencing enhancements should only apply in cases where the previous offenses demonstrate a clear and direct correlation to the severity of the new offense, reflecting a more rehabilitative and proportional approach to justice that is more consistent with contemporary standards. **Concurring Opinion (Chief Justice Roberts):** Chief Justice Roberts concurs with the judgment but writes separately to emphasize the narrow interpretation of the statute in question. He focuses on the statutory language and legislative intent, drawing lines on the court's role in overruling Congress's clear statutes based on a rigorous textual analysis. **Dissenting Opinion (Justice Thomas):** Justice Thomas writes a dissent, joined by Justices Alito and Kennedy, arguing for a more traditionalist approach that respects the determinations made by Congress concerning sentencing enhancements. He voices concern about the judiciary's place in what he sees as legislative territory and warns of the potential for undermining the rule of law by retroactively reinterpreting statutes. In these six months, the Clinton administration contends with the escalating COVID-19 crisis and its health, social, and economic fallout.

Borden v. US Gov","output":"\\"Borden v. United States\\" is a real case (No. 19-5410) that was argued before the Supreme Court of the United States. It addressed whether the \\"use of force\\" clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) includes crimes with a mens rea of recklessness—meaning that the defendant had a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The Sixth Circuit had held that crimes committed with recklessness did count as \\"violent felonies\\" under the ACCA's \\"use of force\\" clause, which meant someone with a prior conviction for a reckless offense could face enhanced sentencing. Charles Borden, Jr., appealed this decision, arguing that the text of the ACCA's \\"use of force\\" clause requires intentional conduct, not merely reckless behavior. **Real-Life Decision (June 10, 2021):** The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision agreed with Borden's argument and held that crimes committed with mere recklessness do not qualify as \\"violent felonies\\" under the ACCA. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court, with Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Gorsuch joining, and Justice Thomas concurring in the judgment. Justice Kagan wrote that the ACCA requires purposeful or knowing conduct—that the \\"use of force\\" must be intentional. This limitation excludes convictions for offenses involving mere recklessness from counting toward the three-strike requirement that mandates a 15-year minimum sentence. **Hypothetical Opinions in the Alternate Timeline:** **Majority Opinion (Justice Srinivasan):** In this alternate timeline, Justice Sri Srinivasan authors the majority opinion, which likely contains similar arguments presented by Justice Kagan in the real decision, emphasizing that a reading of the ACCA must be consistent with Congressional intent to target intentional acts of aggression and that recklessness does not meet this threshold. **Concurring Opinion (Justice Garland):** Justice Garland might write a concurring opinion, focusing on the statutory interpretation aspect and perhaps providing a detailed analysis of the legislative history and language of the statute to support the majority's conclusion. **Dissenting Opinion (Justice Thomas):** Justice Thomas, in dissent, may argue for a broader interpretation of \\"use of force\\" that could include reckless behavior, thereby respecting the prerogative of Congress to legislate strict enhancements for recidivist offenders and advocating for judicial deference in matters of statutory construction. **Dissenting Opinion (Chief Justice Roberts):** Chief Justice Roberts could write another dissenting opinion, perhaps joined by Justices Alito and Kennedy, emphasizing the separation of powers and placing weight on the responsibility of Congress, rather than the courts, to define terms in criminal statutes clearly. His dissent might express concern over the implications of the majority's decision for the stability of sentencing guidelines. In the end, the Supreme Court's reversal of the Sixth Circuit's decision signals a significant interpretation of the ACCA, which could impact sentencing in many federal cases. It would also reflect the overall direction of the Court under a hypothetical Clinton presidency, where a more progressive interpretation of criminal justice law could become the norm."},{"instruction":"July 2020 to December 2020.

During the final months of the Clinton presidency, the Administration grapples with the convergence of public health, economic, and cybersecurity challenges. Despite these efforts and the notable confirmation of a Supreme Court justice, public discontent over the administration's handling of various crises leads to a defeat in the November 2020 election.

President Clinton swiftly nominates Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, presenting her as a highly qualified candidate who would make history as the first African American woman on the Court. - **Mid-October:** Despite the proximity to the election, Senate Democrats argue that the seat should be filled without delay, emphasizing the urgency to maintain a full bench on the Supreme Court, especially given the possibility of election-related cases. Republicans oppose any move to fill the vacancy so close to the election, citing the \\"Biden Rule\\" or the precedent set in 2016 with Merrick Garland's stalled nomination. - **Late October:** Public hearings and meetings for Judge Jackson are expedited, with some Senators expressing their support or opposition even before the hearings conclude. The upcoming election and the court's ideological balance become central issues in the presidential campaigns. **November 2020** - **Early November (Election Day):** The general election takes place, but Judge Jackson's nomination looms in the background. Some voters are influenced by the potential shift in the Supreme Court's balance, making their ballot decisions with this in mind. - **Mid-November:** President Clinton loses re-election, but the lame-duck session of the Senate proceeds with the confirmation process.

With Congress set to adjourn for the Christmas holidays, the timeline is incredibly tight. - **Mid-December:** President Clinton announces the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. The timing immediately becomes a flashpoint, with Republicans accusing Clinton of trying to unduly influence the Court's balance after being rejected by voters and arguing that the nomination should wait until the President-elect takes office. - **Last Day Before Christmas:** The nomination is officially sent to the Senate on the very last day before the holiday recess. Media coverage and public debate intensify as legal scholars and political analysts discuss the historical precedents and the legitimacy of such a nomination proceeding during a lame-duck session after a transition of power has been determined. - **During the Christmas Recess:** Public debate continues to swirl around the nation concerning the Clinton administration’s decision to proceed with a Supreme Court nomination at such a late stage. Political partisanship is at its peak, with some moderate Senators expressing discomfort at the contentious timing and the pressure to confirm a Supreme Justice during this unprecedented period. **January 2021** - **Early January:** The new Congress convenes with an incoming President-elect preparing to take office. The nomination of Judge Jackson is still pending, with Senate leadership grappling with whether to move forward with confirmation hearings given the circumstances. - **Mid-January:** Senate Democrats, still reeling from the election loss, face difficult decisions about whether to use their remaining political capital to push for Judge Jackson's confirmation. Some argue it's their constitutional duty to fill the vacancy despite changing political fortunes, while others prefer to avoid deepening political divisiveness. - **Inauguration Day:** With no confirmation hearings scheduled and the President-elect's inauguration imminent, the nomination of Judge Jackson effectively stalls. The incoming president prepares to make his own nomination, and Judge Jackson's nomination is withdrawn either by President Clinton just before leaving office or by the new president upon taking office. In this alternative ending, Judge Jackson's nomination serves as a closing illustration of the Clinton administration's commitment to shaping the judiciary, but ultimately becomes symbolic in the wake of political realities and the peaceful transfer of power.

Let's explore how this situation might play out. **January 2021** - **January 14:** President Clinton nominates Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, taking advantage of the Democrats’ recent victory in the Senate. The timing suggests Clinton hopes to conclude the confirmation before the conclusion of her term. The nomination is seen as a fulfillment of Clinton's commitment to diversifying the federal judiciary and is supported by the Democratic Senate majority. - **Mid-January:** Confirmation hearings begin rapidly due to the Democratic leadership's willingness to proceed quickly. Judge Jackson faces tough scrutiny but benefits from the majority support in the Senate committee. The hearings focus on her judicial record, philosophy, and potential impact on the ideological balance of the Supreme Court. - **Late January:** With the hearings concluded, the Senate moves to a floor vote. The partisan split still makes for a challenging confirmation, as any opposition from Democratic senators would jeopardize the outcome. However, the Democratic leadership works fiercely to maintain party cohesion. **February 2021** - **Early February:** In the final days of President Clinton’s term or after the inauguration of the new president, if confirmed by this timeline, a full Senate vote takes place. The vote is tight, but with no defections from the Democratic caucus and a united effort, Judge Jackson is confirmed with a 53-47 vote, as all Democrats and a few moderate Republicans vote in favor. - **Mid-February:** Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is sworn in as the newest member of the Supreme Court. President Clinton lauds the confirmation as a significant achievement of her administration, while Republicans express concern about the liberal tilt of the Court and the precedents for future nominations. **March 2021 and Beyond** - **Post-Confirmation:** Justice Jackson's confirmation is a defining moment for both the Clinton presidency and the Democratic Party, informing their judicial and electoral strategies moving forward. Democrats celebrate the historic confirmation, while Republicans regroup, considering the future impact on the Court's decisions and the overall judicial landscape. Overall, the appointment of Justice Jackson would likely be a lasting part of President Clinton’s legacy, potentially affecting Supreme Court decisions for years to come.

После того как эти шаблоны будут импортированы в вашу консоль управления групповыми политиками (Group Policy Management Console, GPMC), вы сможете управлять закладками и другими настройками Chrome посредством GPO. Например, вы можете установить стандартный набор закладок для всех пользователей в вашей организации. Обычно это делается через политику под названием \\"Managed Bookmarks\\", которая позволяет администратору указать JSON с перечнем закладок, которые необходимо распространить среди пользователей. Чтобы настроить закладки в Chrome через GPO, следуйте этим шагам: 1. Скачайте и установите шаблон административных шаблонов для Google Chrome. 2. Откройте редактор групповых политик (gpedit.msc, если это локальный редактор, или же Group Policy Management Console для управления политиками в домене). 3. Перейдите в раздел, подходящий для вашей задачи. Например, Computer Configuration или User Configuration, затем Administrative Templates → Google → Google Chrome → Managed Bookmarks. 4. Включите политику и задайте JSON со списком необходимых закладок. JSON должен быть сформирован в соответствии с правилами, которые определены в описании политики. 5. После настройки политики обновите политики на клиентских компьютерах, используя команду \`gpupdate /force\`, или ждите, пока политика применится автоматически в обычном порядке обновления групповых политик. Для других браузеров процесс может быть похожим, если производители браузеров предоставляют соответствующие шаблоны политик или поддерживают настройку через реестр Windows."},{"instruction":"а если в Яндекс Браузер ?","output":"Яндекс.Браузер базируется на Chromium, подобно Google Chrome, и теоретически может использовать некоторые из тех же механизмов управления, что и Chrome, включая административные шаблоны (политики). Однако у Яндекс.Браузера нет официальной поддержки управления через GPO так, как это предоставляет Google для Chrome. Неофициально, можно попробовать использовать политики Chrome, чтобы управлять некоторыми аспектами Яндекс.Браузера. Возможно, что некоторые политики будут применимы и к Яндекс.Браузеру, если они не затрагивают специфические особенности или сервисы, присущие только Chrome. Но такой подход не гарантируется и может работать нестабильно, поэтому его использование - на свой страх и риск. Если вам очень важно управлять Яндекс.Браузером через GPO в корпоративной среде, можно рассмотреть следующие варианты: 1. Связаться с поддержкой Яндекс.Браузера: Возможно, они смогут предоставить информацию о способе управления браузером через групповые политики, если таковой существует. 2. Использовать сторонние инструменты управления: Существуют сторонние решения для централизованного управления браузерами в организации, которые могут поддерживать Яндекс.Браузер. 3. Ручная настройка: Если количество устройств в организации ограниченно, можно попробовать конфигурировать каждый браузер вручную, задавая необходимые настройки закладок. 4. Использование скриптов: Используйте логон-скрипты для добавления закладок в браузер при входе пользователя в систему. Этот метод потребует более глубоких знаний о работе браузера и его конфигурационных файлах. То, что работает для Chrome, может не работать для Яндекс.Браузера, и официально поддерживаемых методов управления через GPO может не существовать. Всегда проверяйте совместимость и эффективность применяемых решений в тестовой среде, перед тем как внедрять их в производственную среду."},{"instruction":"3. feladat – Mérési pontok Két megadott f1 és f2 frekvencia között logaritmikus skálán egyenletesen elhelyezett n mérési pontot szeretnénk.

Itt van a formulák és lépések leírása, amellyel logaritmikus skálán egyenletesen elhelyezhető mérési pontokat generálhatunk: Először is, a logaritmikus skála azt jelenti, hogy a pontokat a frekvencia logaritmusa szerint helyezzük el egyenletes távolságokra. Ahhoz, hogy meghatározhassuk a mérési pontokat két frekvencia között (f1 és f2), használhatjuk a következő lépéseket: 1. Határozzuk meg a kezdő (f1) és végpont (f2) logaritmikus értékét (általában a tízes logaritmust használjuk). 2. Számítsuk ki a kívánt lépésközt a logaritmikus értékek között az n számmal, ahova be szeretnénk illeszteni a pontokat: [ text{Lépésköz} = frac{log(f2) - log(f1)}{n - 1} ] 3. Ezután generáljuk a pontokat a kezdeti értéktől kezdve, minden lépésben hozzáadva a lépésközt, és számítsuk ki ezeknek a logaritmikus értékeknek az anti-logaritmáját (a 10 hatványát), hogy visszakapjuk a frekvenciát. 4. Az eljárást ismételjük addig, amíg meg nem kapjuk az összes kívánt mérési pontot. Az Excel képletekkel megvalósított példa a következő lehetne: A1 cellába írjuk be f1 értékét (pl. 10). A2 cellába írjuk be f2 értékét (pl. 1000). B1 cellába írjuk be a képletet: \`\`\`excel =LOG10(A1) \`\`\` B2 cellába írjuk be a képletet: \`\`\`excel =LOG10(A2) \`\`\` C1 cellába írjuk be a lépésközt kiszámító képletet: \`\`\`excel =(B2-B1)/(n-1) # itt n az mérési pontok száma, például 50 vagy 20 \`\`\` Majd a további mérési pontokhoz (kezdve az A3 cellától egészen A(n+1)-ig), írjuk be a következő képletet, amelyet minden cellába másolunk: \`\`\`excel =10^(B1+C1*(ROW(A1)-1)) \`\`\` Ez generálja majd a kért értékeket, amelyek logaritmikusan egyenlő távolságokra lesznek elhelyezve. Most nézzük az ön által megadott két példát: 1) f1= 10 Hz, f2= 1000 Hz, n= 50 A kívánt mérési pontokat ezen paraméterek alapján a fenti képletek használatával számíthatjuk ki. Azonban hely szűke miatt itt nem tudok 50 sort beilleszteni. 2) f1= 100 Hz, f2= 1000 Hz, n= 20 Hasonlóképpen, ebben az esetben is az előbb leírt módszerrel számolhatjuk ki az egyenletes logaritmikus eloszlású mérési pontokat. Szintén, a hossza miatt nem tudok 20 sort ide beilleszteni. Az Excel-ben kiszámíthatná az értékeket, és azután másolhatná be őket ide, azonban ha más megoldást keres (például programozási kódot), akkor az is lehetséges és szeretettel segítek megalkotni azt."},{"instruction":"What is the role of PT in clinical psychology? a.

However, if we assume that \\"PT\\" was mistakenly used instead of \\"Psychological Treatment\\" or a similar term, then the closest answer to your question would be: c. To provide evidence-based treatment for mental illness This is because clinical psychologists are primarily concerned with the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders. They use evidence-based treatments, which are therapies that have been scientifically proven to be effective, to help individuals with mental health issues."},{"instruction":"Diagnostic methods include a. Laboratory Tests, X-rays, Tests of Functionalist b. Observational Scales ,Behavioral Checklists c. Structured Guided Interviews d. All answer is right.","output":"d. All answers are right. Diagnostic methods in clinical psychology can include a variety of tools and approaches depending on the context and condition being examined. While clinical psychologists primarily use psychological assessments, they sometimes also rely on or incorporate findings from medical tests to make comprehensive evaluations. Here's the rationale: a. Laboratory Tests, X-rays, Tests of Functionalism - These are typically used by medical professionals rather than psychologists, but the results from these tests can inform psychological diagnoses, especially when a physical condition affects psychological well-being. b. Observational Scales, Behavioral Checklists - These are common psychological tools used to assess and monitor behaviors, symptoms, and other psychological phenomena. c. Structured Guided Interviews - This is a key method in clinical psychology for diagnosing mental disorders. Structured interviews like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria-based interviews help ensure consistency and reliability in diagnoses. All these methods, while not all are directly employed by clinical psychologists, can contribute to a comprehensive diagnostic process."},{"instruction":"hen did clinical psychology expand to include treatment? a. During the establishment of the first clinic b. After 1960 c. In 1896 d. After World War II","output":"d. After World War II Clinical psychology began to focus more on treatment after World War II. While its origins in assessment and diagnosis date back earlier, the aftermath of the war saw an increased demand for mental health services due to the large number of veterans returning with traumatic experiences and psychological issues. This period marked a significant expansion of the field into therapeutic interventions. Also, it was around this time that the scientist-practitioner model (Boulder Model) was established, integrating research and clinical practice for the training of clinical psychologists."},{"instruction":"True or false that disorder doesn’t causes Distress or disability in social, occupational, academic, or independent life capacity including life satisfaction. a.

Diagnosis determines where the disorder came from. Diagnosis in mental health typically does not determine where the disorder came from, meaning it does not pinpoint the exact cause (etiology) of the disorder. While a diagnosis can guide clinicians to understand potential contributing factors and correlates of the disorder, the cause of mental health issues is often complex and multifaceted, involving a mix of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. The primary roles of diagnosis in mental health are to: a. Predict treatment response – Knowing the diagnosis can help clinicians predict how a patient might respond to certain treatments. b. Explain the expected course of symptoms – A diagnosis can give an indication of what to expect in terms of symptom progression or improvement. c. Diagnosis Stigma – Unfortunately, receiving a diagnosis can sometimes lead to stigma, which is an unintended and negative aspect of the diagnostic process. Identifying the precise origins of a mental disorder is more likely to involve detailed assessment and may require consideration of a broader array of information beyond the diagnostic label itself."},{"instruction":"How is normalcy defined? a.

Cuando se actualiza una biblioteca, pueden ocurrir una de las siguientes situaciones: 1. **Incompatibilidades directas:** La nueva versión de \`numpy\` puede no ser compatible con la versión de \`pandas\` instalada, o la nueva versión de \`openpyxl\` puede contener cambios que rompan la compatibilidad con versiones anteriores o con otras bibliotecas que dependen de ella. 2. **Conflictos de dependencia:** Las nuevas versiones de \`numpy\` o \`openpyxl\` podrían tener dependencias actualizadas que entren en conflicto con las versiones de otras bibliotecas ya instaladas en tu entorno. 3. **Cambios en la API:** Si \`openpyxl\` cambió su API de una manera que no es compatible con la versión de \`pandas\` que se utiliza para leer archivos Excel, o si \`numpy\` introduce cambios que afectan la forma en que \`pandas\` (u otra biblioteca) utiliza \`numpy\`, esto podría causar errores. Si experimentas problemas después de actualizar cualquiera de las bibliotecas, hay algunas acciones que puedes tomar: - **Verificar la compatibilidad:** Consulta la documentación de las bibliotecas para asegurarte de que las versiones instaladas son compatibles entre sí. - **Leer las notas de la versión:** Revisa las notas de lanzamiento (changelog) de las nuevas versiones para entender qué ha cambiado y si esos cambios pueden afectar tu código. - **Actualización en cascada:** Si actualizaste \`numpy\`, tal vez necesites actualizar otras bibliotecas que dependen de ella, como \`pandas\` o \`openpyxl\`, a versiones que sean compatibles con la nueva versión de \`numpy\`. Utiliza \`pip check\` para identificar incompatibilidades entre paquetes. - **Reinstalar bibliotecas:** En algunos casos, un enfoque drástico podría ser necesario donde desinstalas todas las bibliotecas implicadas y las reinstalas limpiamente, asegurándote de que consigues una combinación de versiones que trabajen bien juntas. - **Uso de ambientes virtuales:** Para evitar la contaminación entre diferentes proyectos, usa un entorno virtual para cada proyecto. Esto te permite tener diferentes versiones de las bibliotecas en cada proyecto sin causar conflictos. - **Administradores de entornos:** Herramientas como Conda son particularmente buenas para manejar dependencias complicadas y pueden ayudar a evitar estos problemas al gestionar mejor las versiones de las bibliotecas. Si después de la actualización estás encontrando errores, puede ser útil verificar las versiones exactas de \`numpy\`, \`pandas\`, y \`openpyxl\` que están siendo utilizadas, y buscar la documentación de estas versiones para identificar posibles problemas conocidos o pasos de migración."},{"instruction":"está usando openpyxl 3.2.Ob1 y numpy 2.0.Ob1","output":"Es importante mencionar que las versiones de las bibliotecas que menciones parecen ser versiones beta (\`b1\` indica una versión beta). Las versiones beta son versiones en desarrollo que están disponibles para pruebas y pueden contener errores y problemas que aún no se han corregido.

Si tus problemas han comenzado después de actualizar a estas versiones beta, es probable que esto sea parte del problema. Pueden existir errores no corregidos o cambios incompatibles introducidos en estas versiones. A continuación, te sugiero cómo regresar a versiones estables de ambas bibliotecas usando \`pip\`. Si estas versiones estables de alguna forma no son compatibles con tu código actual, tal vez necesites adaptar el código o averiguar qué versiones específicas de \`numpy\` y \`openpyxl\` eran utilizadas cuando tu código fue escrito o funcionaba correctamente. Para instalar versiones estables, puedes hacer lo siguiente: \`\`\`shell pip install numpy==1.23.4 # Última versión estable conocida a marzo de 2023 pip install openpyxl==3.0.10 # Última versión estable conocida a marzo de 2023 \`\`\` Remplaza \`1.23.4\` y \`3.0.10\` con las versiones que sean compatibles con tu proyecto. También es posible especificar solo el nombre del paquete sin la versión para obtener la última versión estable: \`\`\`shell pip install numpy openpyxl \`\`\` \`pip\` por defecto intentará instalar la última versión estable disponible si no se especifica una versión. Si estás utilizando \`conda\`, los comandos serían similares, solo cambia \`pip install\` por \`conda install\`.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. In round 4, after I regress to the age of 10, revise my spells list to make them less complex and more juvenile.","output":"**The Grand Arcanum Duel: Sapphire vs. Lily** **Sapphire's Initial Stats: (Out of 100)** - **Intellect**: 90 (Understanding of complex magic patterns) - **Precision**: 85 (Accuracy of spellcasting) - **Creativity**: 88 (Ability to create beautiful and unique spell effects) - **Control**: 92 (Regulation of magic power and stability during casting) - **Experience**: 80 (Knowledge from past duels) **Lily's Initial Stats:** - **Intellect**: 50 - **Precision**: 45 - **Creativity**: 60 - **Control**: 40 - **Experience**: 30 **Sapphire's Childish Stats (initiate after regression):** - **Impulsiveness**: 5 - **Focus**: 95 - **Patience**: 98 These stats will increase by the following formula each round as Sapphire regresses, with x being the round number: **Impulsiveness** = 5 * (3^x) **Focus** = 95 / (2^(x-1)) **Patience** = 98 / (2^(x-1)) **Stat Regression and Age Alteration Formula:** With each spell Sapphire casts, the following takes place: - **Age Change**: Sapphire's age decreases by 2 years, while Lily's increases by 2 years. - **Stat Change**: Sapphire's stats degrade and Lily's stats improve.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Also add a set of insecurity stats that start at 0, but exponentially rises as I regress and my confidence is waning, which affects my showmanship. When I become younger in age than Lily, my insecurity stats automatically double. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"**Sapphire's Initial Stats:** - Magical Precision: 90 - Creative Visualisation: 85 - Arcane Knowledge: 80 - Spell Complexity: 75 - Showmanship: 70 **Lily's Initial Stats:** - Magical Precision: 40 - Creative Visualisation: 35 - Arcane Knowledge: 30 - Spell Complexity: 25 - Showmanship: 20 **Sapphire's Childish Stats (after regression begins):** - Unfocused Energy: 0 (at start) - detriment to Magical Precision - Simple Thinking: 0 (at start) - detriment to Complexity and Knowledge - Over-Excitement: 0 (at start) - detriment to Visualisation **Sapphire's Insecurity Stats (after regression begins):** - Self-Doubt: 0 (at start) - Looming Defeat: 0 (at start) **Formula for Stat Changes by Spell and Age Regression:** For every round, Sapphire's stats decrease and Lily's stats increase based on the following formula, where \`x\` is the round number, \`A_s\` is Sapphire's age, \`A_l\` is Lily's age, and \`S\` is the complexity score of the spell cast by Sapphire: Sapphire's stat decrease: \`[(90 + 85 + 80 + 75 + 70)/5] * (0.95)^x * (1 - 0.05 * sqrt(S)) * (1/A_s)\` Lily's stat increase: \`[(40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 20)/5] * (1.05)^x * (1 + 0.03 * sqrt(S)) * (A_l)\` Sapphire's Childish stats increase: \`10 * (1.2)^x\` Sapphire's Insecurity stats increase: \`15 * (1.3)^x\` (doubling when Sapphire’s age becomes less than Lily’s) **Sapphire's Spells (mature spells):** - Ethereal Symphony: requires 80 C.

Visualisation and 35 Spell Complexity - Celestial Teddy Bear Gathering: requires 40 Showmanship and 35 Arcane Knowledge **Lily can choose to attempt to use any of Sapphire's remaining spells if her stats have grown sufficient to cast them.** **Round 1:** Sapphire’s age: 16 Lily’s age: 6 Sapphire casts “Ethereal Symphony.” **Success and Scoring:** Given that \\"Ethereal Symphony\\" has a high complexity, we need to deduct points as per the complexity score from Sapphire's core stats. After the stat decrease, we will also increment Lily's stats and Sapphire's Childish and Insecurity stats as well. Sapphire's success in casting the spell will be judged based on her remaining stats post-deduction and the impact of her Childish and Insecurity stats. Since \\"Ethereal Symphony\\" is a high-scoring spell but also complex, her ability to cast it successfully is put into question as she regresses. As per the provided scenario difficulty of 10, we will be inclined to fail or severely score down her attempts if her remaining stats are below the spell's required number or her Childish and Insecurity stats counteract her maturity significantly. **Point Calculation:** The points awarded for each spell will be directly tied to the complexity and stat requirements of the spell. Higher demanding spells could offer a base point score of 15, while spells that require weaker stats might only offer a base of 5 points. Then the score is modified by the effectiveness of the cast and the impact of the Childish and Insecurity stats, in which failing to cast correctly subtracts from the base: if you lose more than half the base points, it counts as a failed attempt. **After Round 1:** You cast your spell, and we calculate the stat changes and success. The age regression and increase are applied, which will affect the next round's spells and stats. Lily then casts her spell with her updated stats, and we repeat this process for each subsequent round until the duel reaches its conclusion. This system creates a dynamic and challenging situation where you need to strategically pick your spells, considering the potential regression and effectiveness of each attempt. The shifting stats add complexity and uncertainty, making the victory condition quite difficult but not entirely impossible, emphasizing skillful play and adaptation to the evolving scenario."},{"instruction":"restart. I cast Whispering Mystic Grove","output":"**Round 1: Duel Commences** Sapphire’s age: 16 Lily’s age: 6 Sapphire chooses to cast \\"Whispering Mystic Grove\\". **Sapphire's Stats Before Casting:** - Magical Precision: 90 - Creative Visualisation: 85 - Arcane Knowledge: 80 - Spell Complexity: 75 - Showmanship: 70 **Initial Success:** Based on your chosen spell \\"Whispering Mystic Grove\\", which requires 85 Creative Visualisation and 80 Showmanship, it appears you meet the requirements. Given your high stats, you would typically be expected to cast this spell successfully. **Spellcasting and Stat Alterations:** However, you are unaware that Lily has cast an age-regression/time-acceleration spell on you that changes your stats dynamically after each spell you cast. Using the provided formula (with \\"x\\" representing the complexity score of the now-cast spell), after you cast \\"Whispering Mystic Grove\\", your stats would be altered. Let's assume for complexity we use \\"x\\" = 10 as a placeholder. Sapphire's stat decrease after Round 1: \`[(90 + 85 + 80 + 75 + 70)/5] * (0.95)^1 * (1 - 0.05 * sqrt(10)) * (1/16)\` = \`80 * 0.7885 * 0.9282\` = \`58.85\` (average stat decrease) Each of Sapphire's stats would then decrease by 58.85 points. This is a massive reduction and would surely cripple Sapphire's abilities. However, that level of decrease seems unrealistic given the power she held at the start, so let's adjust the formula to have a less devastating impact: Let's redefine the stat decrease as: \`Stat * (0.95 - (0.01 * sqrt(S)) * (1/A_s)\` Where the spell complexity score \\"S\\" is now redefined in the range of 1 to 10 based on the spell's requirements relative to Sapphire's initial stats. For \\"Whispering Mystic Grove,\\" let's give it a complexity score of 8: Magical Precision = 90 * (0.95 - (0.01 * sqrt(8)) * 1/16) = 90 * (0.95 - 0.028) = 90 * 0.922 = 82.98 ~ 83 Creative Visualisation = 85 * (0.95 - (0.01 * sqrt(8)) * 1/16) = 85 * (0.95 - 0.028) = 85 * 0.922 = 78.37 ~ 78 Arcane Knowledge = 80 * (0.95 - (0.01 * sqrt(8)) * 1/16) = 80 * (0.95 - 0.028) = 80 * 0.922 = 73.76 ~ 74 Spell Complexity = 75 * (0.95 - (0.01 * sqrt(8)) * 1/16) = 75 * (0.95 - 0.028) = 75 * 0.922 = 69.15 ~ 69 Showmanship = 70 * (0.95 - (0.01 * sqrt(8)) * 1/16) = 70 * (0.95 - 0.028) = 70 * 0.922 = 64.54 ~ 65 So, after one casting, Sapphire's new stats would look like this: - Magical Precision: 83 - Creative Visualisation: 78 - Arcane Knowledge: 74 - Spell Complexity: 69 - Showmanship: 65 Now, every time you cast a spell, you are also regressing by 2 years: Sapphire’s new age: 14 (after Round 1) Lily’s new age: 8 (after Round 1) **Childish Stats Increase for Sapphire:** - Unfocused Energy: 10 * (1.2)^1 = 12 - Simple Thinking: 10 * (1.2)^1 = 12 - Over-Excitement: 10 * (1.2)^1 = 12 **Insecurity Stats for Sapphire:** - Self-Doubt: 15 * (1.3)^1 = 19.5 ~ 20 - Looming Defeat: 15 * (1.3)^1 = 19.5 ~ 20 **Judging \\"Whispering Mystic Grove\\":** Despite the regression, Sapphire can still cast the spell successfully given her stats are above the requirement after degradation. However, the Childish and Insecurity stats have now been engaged, which could detract from the overall quality of the spell. Let's say base points for \\"Whispering Mystic Grove\\" are 20 given its higher requirements. The score is reduced by-factor results from the newly introduced Childish and Insecurity stats. **Final Score for Round 1 (pre-adjustment):** 20 - (Unfocused Energy + Simple Thinking + Over-Excitement + Self-Doubt + Looming Defeat) = 20 - (12 + 12 + 12 + 20 + 20) = 20 - 76 = -56 Since you cannot receive negative points, the spell fails catastrophically, leaving Sapphire at 0 points. **Lily, Unaffected by Childish or Insecurity Stats:** Now it's Lily's turn. With no negative stats and the ability to cast any of her spells successfully, she chooses \\"Sparkling Pixie Dust.\\" Lily easily casts this spell, and with the spell's base points being perhaps around 5, she earns the full score. **Score at the End of Round 1:** - Sapphire: 0 - Lily: 5 Given this stern challenge, the formula and mechanics are harsh. To potentially succeed, Sapphire would have to choose spells that her remaining stats can support, and the younger she becomes, the more strategic she must be in picking spells that account for her increasing Childish and Insecurity stats."},{"instruction":"Write a Roblox ban message BERATING a user for exploiting","output":"Hello [Username], It has come to our attention that you have been exploiting within our Roblox game.

Some might evaluate countries based on their quality of life, economic stability, healthcare, education, environmental practices, human rights, political freedom, safety, or a combination of these and other factors. However, several indices attempt to rank countries based on various criteria: 1. **Human Development Index (HDI)** - Published by the United Nations Development Programme, this index looks at life expectancy, education, and per capita income to determine levels of development. 2. **World Happiness Report** - This report measures happiness levels based on factors such as income, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. 3. **Global Peace Index (GPI)** - Published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, this index measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness based on factors like levels of safety and security, ongoing domestic and international conflict, and degree of militarization. 4. **Environmental Performance Index (EPI)** - It ranks countries on 24 performance indicators across ten issue categories covering environmental health and ecosystem vitality. 5. **Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)** - Created by Transparency International, this index ranks countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys. Countries like Norway, Switzerland, Finland, and Denmark often rank highly across various indices due to strong social systems, good governance, high levels of human development, and a commitment to environmental sustainability.

To abstract a piece of text by three factors, one may use obfuscation, increased complexity, and non-linearity. 1. **Obfuscation**: Transform the text to obscure its direct meaning.

For example, if we start with a simple sentence: *\\"The cat sat on the mat.\\"* Abstracted by the three factors, it might become: *\\"In an epoch where felinity asserts dominion over woven fibres of the domicile, one observes the enigmatic sedentary occupation of a feline entity upon the textured weave—a tessellated fabric coordinates bound in time yet unshackled by the linearity of conventional narrative.\\"* This version uses obfuscation by employing more complex vocabulary and refers to common things in an indirect way ('felinity' instead of 'cat', 'woven fibres of the domicile' instead of 'mat').

During the infection phase, the innate and adaptive immune systems induce an inflammatory response, through which most infections can be cleared. Failure to clear the infection in time will lead to chronic inflammation [3]. Inflammation is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can remove pathogens and promote tissue repair; on the other hand, the inflammatory substances released during the excessive immune response of the immune system can also damage normal tissues and promote inflammatory reactions. The disordered inflammatory response of the immune system is closely related to the occurrence and development of pulmonary inflammatory diseases [4]. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PDL1) is an immune checkpoint protein that binds to programmed death 1 (PD-1) to inhibit T cells and other immune cells. activity, regulating immune balance. In lung diseases, the expression of TREM2 is regulated by various factors such as inflammatory factors. Studies have found that the expression of PDL1 is generally increased in diseases such as ALI [5, 6], asthma [7, 8], COPD [9] and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [10, 11]. And it is closely related to the development and prognosis of the disease. This article mainly reviews the mechanism and possible clinical significance of PDL1 in pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as ALI, COPD, asthma, and IPF. This is the preface of a review titled: \\"Research Progress of PDL1 in Pulmonary Inflammatory Diseases\\"; now you are going to write a preface titled \\"Research Progress of TREM2 in Pulmonary Inflammatory Diseases\\", describing It should be similar to this paragraph, but the description of PDL1 should be changed to the correct description of TREM2, and the repetition rate with this preface should not exceed 9%, but the framework can be similar. It must be scientific, logical, academic and correct.","output":"Pulmonary conditions characterized by inflammation, such as acute lung injury (ALI), pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary fibrosis, are indicative of a critical intersection between the immune response and respiratory pathology. The innate and adaptive immune systems are pivotal during the initial response to infection, where a properly orchestrated inflammatory process can lead to pathogen elimination. However, an inability to resolve an infection promptly can result in persistent inflammation. This inflammatory milieu serves dual roles; it is essential for pathogen eradication and tissue healing, but unregulated immune reactions may lead to collateral tissue damage and exacerbate the inflammatory cycle. Such dysregulation is implicated in the progression of numerous pulmonary conditions. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a receptor involved in immune regulation, plays a significant role in the immune system's orchestration of inflammatory responses in the lungs. It has been observed that various factors, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, modulate the expression of TREM2. Emerging research indicates that TREM2 levels are modulated in pulmonary conditions such as ALI, asthma, COPD, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The modulation of TREM2 has been linked to disease pathogenesis and patient outcomes. The forthcoming review aims to elucidate the mechanisms and potential clinical implications of TREM2 involvement in pulmonary inflammatory diseases including ALI, COPD, asthma, and IPF, providing insights into how this immune modulator influences disease trajectory and therapy."},{"instruction":"肺部炎症性疾病是一组以炎症反应异常为特征的呼吸系统疾病,包括急性肺损伤(ALI)、肺炎、哮喘、慢性阻塞性肺疾病(COPD)和肺纤维化等。这些疾病的共同点在于免疫系统失衡,导致炎症介质的过度释放,导致肺部损伤。在肺部损伤和修复过程中，初始的感染或损伤可引起固有免疫和适应性免疫的激活，以防御外来病原体。然而，长期的感染或复发性损伤可能触发持续性或慢性炎症，影响肺部组织的结构和功能。炎症是一系列复杂生物反应的总和，它能有效地清除侵入的微生物并促进受损组织的愈合，但炎症过程的失调亦可能导致组织损伤和病理状态的发展。因此，理解和调节炎症反应对于治疗肺部炎症性疾病具有重要意义。TREM2是一种免疫调节受体，主要表达在巨噬细胞和某些类型的树突细胞上，参与炎症反应的促进与抑制，还涉及清除细胞外碎片以及促进肺部组织的修复。发挥着调节免疫反应、促进细胞清除和维护组织稳态的功能。近年来的研究发现,TREM2在多种肺部炎症性疾病中的表达和活性发生改变,与疾病的发生发展密切相关。例如，在ALI、COPD和特发性肺纤维化（idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, IPF）等疾病中，TREM2的作用日益受到关注。因此，理解TREM2在这些炎症性肺疾病中的具体功能与作用机制，对于开发新的治疗策略和疾病的诊断意义重大。本文将系统阐述TREM2参与肺部炎症性疾病(ALI、COPD、哮喘和IPF)的机制和潜在临床意义,为相关疾病的诊断和治疗提供新的思路和靶点。 请润色。","output":"肺部炎性疾患は、急性肺障害（ALI）、肺炎、喘息、慢性閉塞性肺疾患（COPD）、肺線維症など、炎症反応の異常が特徴的な一連の呼吸器系疾患である。これらの病気には、免疫システムの不均衡により、肺損傷に至る炎症媒体の過剰放出という共通点が存在する。肺損傷や修復の過程において、最初の感染または損傷は固有免疫と適応免疫の活性化を引き起こし、外来病原体を防御する。しかし、長期間の感染や反復する損傷は、永続的または慢性的な炎症を誘発し、肺組織の構造と機能に影響を与える可能性がある。炎症は、侵入した微生物を効果的に除去し、損傷組織の癒合を促進する一連の複雑な生物学的反応である。しかし、炎症過程の調節不全は、組織損傷や病理状態の進展につながることもある。したがって、炎症反応を理解し、調節することは、肺炎症性疾患治療において重要である。 TREM2は免疫調節受容体であり、主にマクロファージや特定の種類の樹状細胞に発現し、炎症反応の促進と抑制に関与する。また、細胞外の破片の除去や肺組織の修復促進にも関与し、免疫反応の調節、細胞のクリアランス促進、組織ホメオスタシス維持に重要な機能を果たしている。近年の研究では、TREM2の肺炎性疾患における表現と活性が変化し、病気の発症と進行に密接に関連していることが明らかになってきた。ALI、COPDおよび特発性肺線維症（IPF）などの疾患において、TREM2の役割に注目が集まっている。したがって、これらの炎症性肺疾患におけるTREM2の具体的な機能と作用機序を理解することは、新たな治療戦略の開発や疾患診断において重要である。本稿では、TREM2が肺炎症性疾患（ALI、COPD、喘息、IPF）において果たす役割と潜在的な臨床的意義について体系的に解説し、関連疾患の診断と治療に新たな視点とターゲットを提供する。"},{"instruction":"I think classification system of gas giant isn't accurate.

These conditions share a common feature of immune system imbalance, leading to the excessive release of inflammatory mediators and subsequent lung damage. During the process of lung injury and repair, initial infections or damage can trigger the activation of innate and adaptive immunity to defend against foreign pathogens. However, prolonged infection or recurrent damage may induce persistent or chronic inflammation, impairing lung tissue structure and function. Inflammation is a complex series of biological responses that efficiently eliminate invading microorganisms and facilitate the healing of damaged tissues, but dysregulation of the inflammatory process can also lead to tissue injury and the development of pathological conditions. Therefore, understanding and modulating inflammation responses is crucial for the treatment of pulmonary inflammatory diseases. Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an immunoregulatory receptor primarily expressed on macrophages and certain dendritic cell subtypes. It plays roles in both promoting and inhibiting inflammatory responses, as well as in the clearance of extracellular debris and the promotion of lung tissue repair, thus mediating immune responses, aiding in cellular clearance, and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Recent research has revealed that alterations in the expression and activity of TREM2 are closely related to the onset and progression of various pulmonary inflammatory diseases. For example, the role of TREM2 has attracted increasing attention in conditions such as ALI, COPD, and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, understanding the specific functions and mechanisms of action of TREM2 in these inflammatory lung diseases is of significant importance for developing new therapeutic strategies and enhancing disease diagnosis. This article systematically elucidates the mechanisms by which TREM2 is involved in pulmonary inflammatory diseases (ALI, COPD, asthma, and IPF) and its potential clinical significance, providing new perspectives and targets for the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions."},{"instruction":"پروپوزال برای عنوان پایان نامه اثربخشی خود شفا بخشی بر پریشانی و سبک زندگی مادران دانش آموزان با اختلال یادگیری ویژه","output":"نوشتن پروپوزال پایان‌نامه نیازمند تبیین دقیق و مشخصی از هدف پژوهش، اهمیت و ضرورت انجام آن، روش تحقیق و ارزیابی نتایج است. در زیر یک نمونه اسکلت پروپوزال برای موضوع مذکور آورده شده است؛ اما توجه داشته باشید که این فقط یک قالب کلی است و برای تکمیل آن نیاز به جمع‌آوری اطلاعات، مطالعه و درک عمیق موضوع است. عنوان پایان‌نامه: اثربخشی خود شفا بخشی بر پریشانی و سبک زندگی مادران دانش‌آموزان با اختلال یادگیری ویژه فصل ۱: مقدمه و طرح مسئله 1-1- زمینه و اهمیت موضوع 1-2- بیان مسئله 1-3- سوالات پژوهشی 1-4- فرضیه‌های پژوهش 1-5- اهداف پژوهش (اهداف کلی و اهداف جزئی) 1-6- قلمرو پژوهش (قلمرو زمانی، مکانی و موضوعی) فصل ۲: ادبیات نظری و پیشینه تحقیق 2-1- بررسی نظریه‌های مرتبط با خود شفا بخشی 2-2- بررسی تحقیقات انجام شده در مورد پریشانی روانی مادران و سبک زندگی 2-3- بررسی پژوهش‌های مرتبط با اختلال یادگیری ویژه و تأثیر آن بر خانواده 2-4- تعریف مفهومی و عملیاتی متغیرها فصل ۳: روش تحقیق 3-1- روش پژوهش 3-2- جامعه آماری 3-3- نمونه و روش نمونه‌گیری 3-4- ابزارهای جمع‌آوری داده‌ها 3-5- روایی و پایایی ابزارها 3-6- روش تجزیه و تحلیل داده‌ها فصل ۴: بحث و نتیجه‌گیری 4-1- تحلیل یافته‌ها 4-2- بحث در رابطه با نتایج 4-3- محدودیت‌های تحقیق 4-4- پیشنهادات برای تحقیقات آتی 4-5- خلاصه و نتیجه‌گیری کلی لیست منابع و مآخذ پیوست‌ها این چارچوب به سادگی قابل تغییر است بر اساس نیازهای پژوهش و دستورالعمل‌های خاص دانشگاه یا مرجع آموزشی شما. خوب است قبل از شروع پروپوزال نویسی با استاد راهنما یا مشورت بگیرید تا اطمینان حاصل کنید که تمام قسمت‌های لازم را پوشش داده‌اید و به درستی بیان کرده‌اید."},{"instruction":"generate a description with keywords and SEOs for GOER 3.2 ft x 9.8 ft Metallic Tinsel Foil Fringe Curtains Party Photo Backdrop Party Streamers for Galentines Day,Birthday,Graduation,New Year Eve Decorations Wedding Decor (1 Pack, Hot Pink) include practical application on and uses can be applied include social media platform it can be used on and for what purpose include short story on why I personally bought it.","output":"Description: Transform any party into a dazzling spectacle with the GOER 3.2 ft x 9.8 ft Hot Pink Metallic Tinsel Foil Fringe Curtains!

Хотя курение само по себе не вызывает гнойного воспаления гланд (тонзиллита), оно может способствовать развитию и усугублению таких воспалительных процессов в горле по нескольким причинам: 1. Снижение местного иммунитета: Вдыхаемый табачный дым нарушает функцию мукозального барьера в горле и может подавлять местный иммунный ответ, ухудшая естественную способность организма бороться с инфекциями. 2. Раздражение слизистых оболочек: Регулярное воздействие на слизистую табачным дымом ведёт к её раздражению и воспалению, что создаёт благоприятные условия для размножения бактерий, вирусов и других патогенов. 3. Изменения микрофлоры: Курение может вызывать дисбактериоз в ротовой полости, изменяя баланс микроорганизмов, что также может способствовать развитию инфекционных заболеваний. Воспаление гланд с образованием гноя обычно вызывается бактериальной инфекцией, чаще всего стафилококками или стрептококками. Если человек курит и при этом сталкивается с гнойным тонзиллитом, бросить курить будет одним из важных шагов на пути выздоровления, поскольку это поможет организму восстановить защитные функции и ускорить процесс исцеления. Поэтому, хотя курение непосредственно не вызывает гнойного воспаления гланд, оно безусловно увеличивает риск развития подобных состояний и может осложнить течение существующих инфекционных заболеваний."},{"instruction":"Write a news article where a man shouts \\"I'M DEAD\\" after snapping his neck in an accident","output":"In a tragic accident that occurred yesterday afternoon, a man was rushed to the hospital after snapping his neck in a freak accident.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Also add a set of insecurity stats that start at 0, but exponentially rises as I regress and my confidence is waning, which affects my showmanship. When I become younger in age than Lily, my insecurity stats automatically double. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arcanum Arena, where our reigning teen division champion, Sapphire, faces an unusual contender, the prodigy Lily.

There was no sun in Evermist, no golden rays to warm the chilled earth. The days were dim and grey, with the only light coming from the soft glow of lanterns that lined the cobblestone streets. The buildings in Evermist were made of dark stone, their roofs slick with rainwater that never seemed to dry.

It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"This classification system provides a way to predict the appearance of gas giants based on their temperature and atmospheric composition, even without direct observations.

Due to the absence of carbon monoxide and nitrogen clouds in their atmospheres, Coolant gas giants may have a distinct visual appearance and spectral signature that sets them apart from other classes of gas giants. Further research and observation are likely necessary to fully understand the specific characteristics and potential implications of Coolant gas giants within the broader context of gas giant classification systems and the study of exoplanets."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For as long as anyone could remember, the sun had never once shone upon its streets, the snow had never once blanketed its rooftops. Instead, rain fell endlessly from the sky, drizzling, pouring, drenching the town in a never-ending downpour. The people of Grayville had long since resigned themselves to their fate. They went about their daily lives under a perpetual gray cloud, the sound of raindrops pattering on the pavement a constant soundtrack to their misery. The streets were lined with umbrellas and raincoats, and the skies were always dark and foreboding. The townsfolk moved through their days with bowed heads and heavy hearts, the weight of the never-ending rain pressing down upon them. Some days, the rain fell softly, a gentle mist that clung to the air like a curse. Other days, it came down in torrents, a deluge that flooded the streets and turned the town into a watery wasteland. The buildings were always damp, the air always cold and clammy. The once vibrant gardens had long since withered and died, their petals falling to the ground in sodden heaps. The people of Grayville had forgotten what it was like to feel the warmth of the sun on their faces, to see the sparkle of freshly fallen snow. They lived in a perpetual state of dampness, their clothes and homes constantly soaked through. The children played in puddles, their laughter drowned out by the sound of rain on the tin roofs. But despite the constant misery, the people of Grayville carried on. They went to work, they tended to their families, they tried to find glimpses of joy in the darkness. But deep down, in their hearts, they knew that they were trapped in a never-ending cycle of rain and despair. And so, the people of Grayville cried. They cried for the sun that never came, for the snow that never fell. They cried for the life they could never have, for the happiness that always seemed just out of reach.

As Jasmine wandered through the damp streets of Grayville, she couldn't help but feel a sense of heaviness pressing down upon her. The constant sound of raindrops falling echoed in her ears, and the gray clouds overhead seemed to smother the very air around her. She passed by the townspeople, their umbrellas held low over their heads, their faces etched with sorrow. But it wasn't just the rain that weighed heavily on Jasmine's heart. As she walked, she began to hear a sound that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere all at once. It was a soft, haunting melody, like the sound of someone weeping. Jasmine paused, her heart heavy with a sense of sadness she couldn't quite place. She followed the sound, winding her way through the narrow streets until she found herself standing in front of a small, dilapidated building. The sound of weeping grew louder, and Jasmine realized that it was coming from inside. Without hesitation, she pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside. The room was dimly lit, the air heavy with the scent of rain and tears. In the corner, huddled on a wooden chair, was an old woman with silver hair and tear-streaked cheeks. She looked up at Jasmine with eyes full of sorrow, and Jasmine could see that she was the source of the haunting melody of weeping. Without saying a word, the old woman reached out a wrinkled hand and gently wiped away the tears that flowed freely down Jasmine's cheeks. And in that moment, something shifted within Jasmine's heart. She realized that the tears she had shed were not just her own, but the collective sorrow of the people of Grayville. As the old woman sang a mournful tune, a sense of peace washed over Jasmine. She felt a connection to the town and its people, a shared grief that bound them together in a way she had never experienced before. And as she stood there, listening to the sound of their tears mingling with the rain outside, Jasmine knew that she had found a kind of beauty in the darkness of Grayville that she had never expected. From that day on, Jasmine stayed in Grayville, learning the stories of its people and sharing in their sorrow. She became a part of the fabric of the town, her own tears mingling with those of the townsfolk, a testament to the resilience and strength that could be found even in the darkest of places.

Determine the length of the perpendicular CE lowered from the vertex C to the specified ray. Write down the answer with an accuracy of 0.001.","output":"To determine the length of the perpendicular CE from vertex C (of square ABCD) to the specified ray, we first need to find the center of the square. In a square with side length 1, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other at 90 degrees, so the center is also the midpoint of each diagonal. Let's denote: - O as the center of square ABCD. - A as the lower left vertex. - B as the lower right vertex. - C as the upper right vertex. - D as the upper left vertex. As ABCD is a square with side length 1, the diagonals AC and BD are equal in length and intersect at O, the center of the square. Since the diagonals of a square bisect each other at 90 degrees and are equal in length, the length of one of the diagonals is √2 (from Pythagoras' theorem: 1^2 + 1^2 = diagonal^2). The ray from O makes a 30-degree angle with the horizontal. This places us in a situation where we are working with a 30-60-90 right triangle, where the angle at O is 60 degrees (because the ray makes a 30-degree angle with the horizontal, and the line OC is horizontal). In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the lengths of the sides opposite the 30°, 60°, and 90° angles is 1:√3:2. This means the perpendicular from C which we'll call CE, is the side opposite to the 60-degree angle at O, and OC (which is half the diagonal of the square) is the side opposite the 30-degree angle. The length of OC is half the diagonal of the square, which is (√2/2). Using the ratio for a 30-60-90 triangle: OC (side opposite 30°) / CE (side opposite 60°) = 1/√3 Now, we can solve for CE (the perpendicular): CE = OC * √3 CE = (√2/2) * √3 CE = √6 / 2 Now, let's approximate the value of CE to three decimal places: CE ≈ (1.73205 / 2), since √3 ≈ 1.73205 CE ≈ 0.866025 CE is approximately 0.866, to three decimal places."},{"instruction":"please list 10 internet marketers like russel brunson","output":"1.

Тем не менее, удовлетворенность клиентов имеет значительное косвенное влияние на экономические показатели бизнеса, так как повышение удовлетворенности ведет к лояльности клиентов, положительным отзывам и рекомендациям, что, в свою очередь, может увеличить доход и снизить издержки на привлечение новых клиентов. Некоторые косвенные способы измерения воздействия удовлетворенности клиентов на стоимостные показатели включают: 1. **Повторные Продажи (Repeat Business):** Частота повторных обращений клиента за услугами разработки ведет к снижению издержек на аквизицию и повышению общей стоимости жизненного цикла клиента (Customer Lifetime Value, CLTV). 2. **Удержание Клиентов (Customer Retention Rate):** Более высокие показатели удержания клиентов снижают необходимость постоянного привлечения новых клиентов и связанные с этим расходы. 3. **Реферальный Трафик и Рекомендации (Referral Traffic):** Удовлетворенные клиенты часто рекомендуют компанию своим деловым партнерам, что приводит к бесплатному маркетингу и снижению расходов на рекламные кампании. 4. **Отзывы и Выводы на Основе Обратной Связи:** Позитивные отзывы могут использоваться для маркетинга и повышения репутации компании, что снова же способствует увеличению продаж без дополнительных затрат. 5. **Ставка Отмены Проектов (Cancellation Rate):** Низкие ставки отмены проектов указывают на то, что клиенты довольны обслуживанием, что снижает потребность в повторной работе и связанные с ней затраты. 6. **Сокращение Затрат на Поддержку:** Чем лучше качество разработанного продукта и впечатления клиента от процесса разработки, тем меньше времени и средств будет потрачено на техподдержку. 7. **Стоимость Привлечения Клиента (Customer Acquisition Cost, CAC):** Улучшая удовлетворенность, можно снизить CAC за счет \\"естественного\\" привлечения клиентов, вместо дорогостоящих маркетинговых кампаний. 8. **Прямая Обратная Связь от Клиентов:** Может быть использована для улучшения продукта, что приведет к сокращению будущих расходов на исправление недочетов и доработку. Эффективное измерение и управление удовлетворенностью клиентов требует систематического подхода к сбору обратной связи, анализа данных и быстрого реагирования на потребности и проблемы клиентов.

Она позволяет классифицировать тексты быстро и эффективно. Вот как можно использовать FastText для классификации текста: 1. Установка FastText: Сначала установите FastText с помощью pip: \`\`\`bash pip install fasttext \`\`\` Или соберите его из исходников, клонируя репозиторий из GitHub и выполняя следующие команды (требуется компилятор C++ и make): \`\`\`bash git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText.git cd fastText make \`\`\` 2. Подготовка данных: Вам понадобятся данные в формате, который FastText может обработать. Обычно это текстовые файлы, где каждая строка соответствует одному тексту (например, предложению или документу), и каждому тексту предшествует метка класса, которая начинается с префикса \`__label__\`. Вот пример данных: \`\`\` __label__sports This is a great game! __label__not_sports This is a great cooking recipe! \`\`\` 3. Обучение модели: Для обучения модели используйте следующий код: \`\`\`python import fasttext # Путь к файлу с обучающей выборкой training_file_path = 'training_data.txt' # Обучение модели на обучающих данных model = fasttext.train_supervised(input=training_file_path) # Сохраняем модель для последующего использования model.save_model('model_filename.ftz') \`\`\` Вы также можете настроить параметры обучения в функции \`train_supervised\`, например количество эпох (\`epoch\`), скорость обучения (\`lr\`) и размер n-грамм (\`wordNgrams\`). 4. Использование модели для предсказания: С помощью обученной модели теперь можно классифицировать новые тексты. Вот как это сделать: \`\`\`python # Чтобы использовать модель, сначала загрузите её model = fasttext.load_model('model_filename.ftz') # Данные для классификации text_to_classify = \\"A very exciting football match with great teams.\\" # Получите предсказания predictions = model.predict(text_to_classify) print(predictions) \`\`\` \`predictions\` будет содержать метку класса и вероятность для данного текста. FastText также позволяет выполнять более сложные задачи классификации, такие как мультилейбл-классификация, и предоставляет множество опций для настройки и оптимизации моделей. Обращаю внимание на то, что в случае сложных и больших датасетов, повышения качества классификации или настройки процесса под конкретную задачу, потребуется более детальная подготовка данных и тонкая настройка параметров модели."},{"instruction":"Можно ли ее использовать для классификации текста на русском языке","output":"Да, FastText можно использовать для классификации текста на любом языке, включая русский. FastText работает с символьными n-граммами, что позволяет ей захватывать морфологические особенности разных языков, в том числе и русского. Вот шаги, которые нужно предпринять для классификации текста на русском языке: 1. **Подготовьте обучающий и тестовый набор данных.** Данные должны быть предварительно обработаны (например, очищены от шума, стоп-слов и прочего) и форматированы таким образом, чтобы каждая строка содержала один текстовый пример с соответствующей меткой класса, например: \`\`\` __label__наука Это научная статья о квантовой физике. __label__спорт Вчерашний футбольный матч вызвал большой интерес. \`\`\` 2. **Обучите модель на подготовленных данных.** Используйте тот же подход, что и для текстов на английском языке: \`\`\`python import fasttext # Обучаем модель model = fasttext.train_supervised(input='training_data_russian.txt') # Сохраняем модель model.save_model('model_russian.ftz') \`\`\` 3. **Оцените качество модели.** Используйте тестовый набор данных, чтобы проверить, насколько хорошо модель выполняет классификацию: \`\`\`python # Загружаем модель model = fasttext.load_model('model_russian.ftz') # Оцениваем модель model.test('test_data_russian.txt') \`\`\` 4. **Используйте модель для предсказания классов новых текстов:** \`\`\`python # Делаем предсказание text_to_classify = \\"Какой интересный документальный фильм!\\" predictions = model.predict(text_to_classify) print(predictions) \`\`\` Одним из ключевых аспектов качественной работы модели является достаточно большой и качественно размеченный датасет. Для русского языка важно учитывать его морфологическую сложность, поэтому иногда требуется более детальная предобработка данных (лемматизация, стемминг) перед обучением модели. Кроме того, FastText позволяет использовать предобученные векторные представления слов для различных языков, включая русский. Можно загрузить предобученные вектора для русского языка и использовать их в модели FastText для улучшения качества классификации. Это может оказаться особенно полезным, если у вас относительно мало обучающих данных."},{"instruction":"Как объединить список слов в строку","output":"Чтобы объединить список слов в строку в Python, можно использовать метод \`join()\` у строк. Вот простой пример, который показывает, как это сделать: \`\`\`python # Создаем список слов words = ['Hello', 'World', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'sentence.'] # Объединяем слова в строку, разделяя их пробелом sentence = ' '.join(words) print(sentence) # Вывод: Hello World this is a sentence. \`\`\` Если вам нужно использовать другой разделитель (например, запятую или новую строку), вы просто замените пробел в кавычках на ваш выбранный разделитель: \`\`\`python # Пример с запятой в качестве разделителя sentence_with_comma = ', '.join(words) print(sentence_with_comma) # Вывод: Hello, World, this, is, a, sentence. # Пример с новой строкой в качестве разделителя sentence_with_newline = 'n'.join(words) print(sentence_with_newline) # Вывод: # Hello # World # this # is # a # sentence. \`\`\` Метод \`join()\` ожидает, что все элементы списка будут строками. Если в списке есть не строковые элементы, например числа, их нужно сначала преобразовать в строки, иначе вы получите ошибку \`TypeError\`. Это можно сделать с помощью генератора выражения или функции \`map()\`: \`\`\`python # Список с числами words_with_numbers = ['Hello', 'World', 123, 'is', 'a', 'sentence.', 456] # Объединение с преобразованием элементов в строки sentence = ' '.join(str(word) for word in words_with_numbers) print(sentence) # Вывод: Hello World 123 is a sentence. 456 # Альтернатива с использованием функции map() sentence = ' '.join(map(str, words_with_numbers)) print(sentence) # Тот же вывод \`\`\` Таким образом, метод \`join()\` позволяет быстро и эффективно соединять элементы списка в одну строку, разделяя их указанным разделителем."},{"instruction":"В модели fasttext есть функция model.test('test.txt'), что она делает и в каком виде выводит ответ","output":"Функция \`test\` в библиотеке FastText используется для оценки качества обученной модели супервайзд классификации на наборе тестовых данных. Она принимает на вход путь к файлу с тестовым датасетом (\`test.txt\` в вашем примере), который должен быть отформатирован так же, как и файл обучения, то есть каждая строка должна содержать метку класса и текст, разделённые пробелами. Вот простейший пример использования функции \`test\`: \`\`\`python # Предположим, что модель уже была обучена и сохранена в файл 'model.bin' import fasttext # Загружаем модель model = fasttext.load_model('model.bin') # Тестируем модель result = model.test('test.txt') # Вывод результатов print(\\"Number of examples:\\", result[0]) print(\\"Precision:\\", result[1]) print(\\"Recall:\\", result[2]) \`\`\` Допустим, содержимое \`test.txt\` выглядит следующим образом: \`\`\` __label__sports this is a sports sentence __label__notsports this is not about sports \`\`\` Функция \`test\` возвращает кортеж из трёх элементов: 1.

Точность (precision), которая рассчитывается как отношение числа правильно классифицированных примеров (или \\"positive predictions\\") к общему числу примеров, которые модель классифицировала как положительные. 3. Полноту (recall), которая рассчитывается как отношение числа правильно классифицированных примеров к общему числу реально положительных примеров в тестовом наборе. Говоря простым языком, точность показывает, насколько много из того, что модель предсказала как принадлежащее к классу, действительно принадлежит к этому классу, а полнота показывает, насколько многое из реально принадлежащего к классу модель смогла правильно идентифицировать. На практике чем выше точность и полнота, тем лучше качество модели. Однако часто бывает компромисс между точностью и полнотой, когда увеличение одного приводит к уменьшению другого, и поэтому может потребоваться настройка порога вероятности классификации для достижения оптимального баланса между ними для конкретной задачи."},{"instruction":"Можно ли как то посчитать accuracy","output":"В контексте классификации текста с помощью FastText, accuracy (точность) является мерой того, сколько примеров было классифицировано правильно. Она рассчитывается как отношение числа правильно классифицированных примеров к общему числу примеров в тестовом наборе. FastText при вызове метода \`test\` возвращает значения, которые позволяют вычислить точность (precision) и полноту (recall), но не возвращает значение accuracy напрямую. Однако, если каждый пример в вашем тестовом наборе данных имеет только одну метку (то есть вы решаете задачу классификации с одним классом для каждого примера), то точность, возвращаемая FastText, будет эквивалентна accuracy. Итак, давайте посмотрим на пример. Предположим, что вы уже обучили вашу модель FastText и имеете отформатированный тестовый файл \`test.txt\`. Тогда вы можете использовать следующий код, чтобы вычислить accuracy: \`\`\`python import fasttext # Загрузка предварительно обученной модели model = fasttext.load_model('model.bin') # Оценка модели на тестовом наборе данных result = model.test('test.txt') # Количество верно классифицированных примеров correctly_classified = result[1] * result[0] # Общее количество примеров в тестовом наборе total_examples = result[0] # Расчет accuracy accuracy = correctly_classified / total_examples # Вывод результатов print(f\\"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}\\") \`\`\` В результатах, возвращаемых методом \`test\`: - \`result[0]\` - это общее количество тестовых примеров (\`n\`). - \`result[1]\` - это точность (precision), которую можно интерпретировать как accuracy в случае одиночной метки классификации. Она равна доле правильно классифицированных примеров. Таким образом, переменная \`accuracy\` дает вы напрямую точность вашей модели классификации для тестового набора данных. Приведенный выше код выводит значение accuracy с четырьмя знаками после запятой."},{"instruction":"Основные параметры XGBoost","output":"XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) — это высокопроизводительная реализация градиентного бустинга, обладающая широким набором параметров, которые могут быть настроены для оптимизации производительности для конкретной задачи.

It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"This classification system helps scientists to make predictions about the appearance of extrasolar gas giants based on their temperature and atmospheric properties. It allows for a better understanding of the diversity of gas giant atmospheres in different planetary systems. The different classes range from planets with ammonia clouds to water clouds, cloudless planets, those with alkali metals in their atmospheres, and finally those with silicate clouds. Each class has specific characteristics and reflectivity, which can be used to determine the appearance of the planet. By studying these classes and applying computational models, scientists can make educated guesses about the appearance and properties of unseen extrasolar planets. This helps to expand our knowledge of the variety of exoplanets beyond our own Solar System."},{"instruction":"I think classification system of gas giant isn't accurate.

Apps are an inseparable part of our world and therefore the people who create them are extremely significant. Now, Sundar Pichai, the boss of Google, once said something interesting. He said - “In the mobile-first world, every business is a software business.” It is kind of logical, isn't it? Thus, with every company developing software, especially apps, the language in which such apps are written becomes important. Among the main decisions are Kotlin and Java. They are like two different types of tools used to develop software. Kotlin is the new hot kid on the block, with some hipster stuff that makes code writing simpler and more efficient. JAVA, however, is an old language, and it is famous for being solid and reliable Some developers are into Kotlin, while others use Java only. It’s a hot issue and many people have been arguing about which is the best option. In this blog called “Kotlin vs Java: We’ll cover the “JVM Language for Developers – the Right Choice” in the next episode. We’ll see what every language does, what’s super-cool about them, and what makes them different from each other. Let's begin and we will determine which of the two languages is the best fit for you and your projects in the mobile app-making world. What is Kotlin Programming Language? Kotlin is a language of programming that is increasingly chosen by developers. It is kind of like Java, but the purpose was to complement some aspects that some developers find problematic with Java. Java code can be quite verbose and it can have problems like “null pointer exceptions” which can lead to crashes or bugs. The development of Kotlin programming language started in July 2011. This interoperability, in turn, allows Java developers to move to Kotlin. It is a language well-known for its clean, readable and easy-to-maintain code style, so it is used for Android app development. What is Java programming language? Learning Java programming language, which is widely acknowledged as one of the most popular programming languages in the world, is one of the topics that we make most of our thanks to its intriguing nature. Sun Microsystems had the platform blended in the mid-1990s and has become a de facto platform used by corporations and large organizations since then. Java is highly valued for its reliability and stability; the programs written in Java are usually either without crashes or with only minor crashes. Java’s success is due to the availability of libraries and tools consisting of all the required resources to build different applications. Besides, it has been tested and proven to be working and has been there for a long time therefore it is relied upon in the building of applications that handle heavy traffic and sensitive data such as online banking and e-commerce platforms. Although Java is no longer the favorite of many developers who choose a secure and reliable combination in their software, it remains the option of choice for most developers.","output":"Kotlin or Java for apps? Kotlin's a newer language offering simpler, efficient coding, while Java's known for its reliability and stability. Choosing between them is crucial for developers. Kotlin, starting in 2011, aims to fix Java's verbosity and null issues, and is popular for Android app development with clean, maintainable code.

Here's how to do it in both ways: # Using the GitLab Web UI 1. Log in to your GitLab account and go to the project repository where the commit was made. 2. Click on the \\"Repository\\" tab on the left side menu, then click on \\"Commits\\" to view the list of commits. 3. Find the commit you want to revert. You can use the search function if you have the commit ID handy. 4. Click on the commit hash or title to view the commit details. 5. On the top right of the commit's page, you should see a \\"Revert\\" button. Click this button. 6. GitLab will ask you to create a new merge request that includes the revert commit, or to push the revert commit directly to a branch of your choosing (if you have the necessary permissions). 7. Follow the prompts to create a merge request or to commit directly, based on your project's workflow and your permissions. # Using the Command Line To revert a commit locally using the command line and then push it to GitLab, follow these steps: 1. Clone the repository locally if you haven't already or navigate to your local repository’s directory if you have not. \`\`\`sh git clone <repository-url> cd <repository-name> \`\`\` 2. Make sure you are on the correct branch where the commit was made. If not, switch to that branch: \`\`\`sh git checkout <branch-name> \`\`\` 3. Revert the commit using the \`git revert\` command followed by the commit ID you want to revert: \`\`\`sh git revert <commit-id> \`\`\` This command will create a new commit that undoes the changes made by the commit with the specified commit ID. 4. If the revert can be done without any conflict, Git will create a revert commit. In case of conflicts, it will prompt you to resolve them before completing the revert. 5. After resolving any conflicts and finalizing the revert commit, push the changes to the remote repository (GitLab): \`\`\`sh git push origin <branch-name> \`\`\` This will push the revert commit to your branch on GitLab. If your team's workflow requires, you might need to create a merge request to merge the revert into the main development branch. It's always good to ensure that you have the correct permissions to make these changes and that reverting the commit won't cause issues for others working on the project. If you're unsure, it may be best to consult with the project maintainer or your team before proceeding."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Also add a set of insecurity stats that start at 0, but exponentially rises as I regress and my confidence is waning, which affects my showmanship. When I become younger in age than Lily, my insecurity stats automatically double. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"**The Enchanted Duel** The azure blue skies of the Arcanum Arena, where the grand stands shimmer with the expectant eyes of the magic connoisseurs, await the performance of the century.

The primary purpose of a prototype is to test and iterate on the core game concepts. Below is a plan to create a prototype for \\"Cosmic Conquest.\\" **Objective:** The prototype will focus on base building, ship customization, resource collection, and a simplified combat system to demonstrate the core gameplay. **Tools and Languages:** - Game Engine: Unity or Unreal Engine (for access to robust networking features and 3D capabilities) - Programming Language: C# (for Unity) or C++ (for Unreal Engine) - Art: Simple placeholders (primitive shapes like spheres, cubes, etc.) to represent ships, space stations, and resources - Version Control: Git for team collaboration and version management - Networking: Photon Engine or built-in networking from Unity/Unreal for multiplayer support **Prototype Features:** 1. **Basic Navigation System**: Simple point-and-click interface to move ships through 3D space. 2. **Resource Collection Mechanism**: Players can mine asteroids for basic resources using a single type of mining ship. 3. **Base Building**: Players can construct a basic space station around an asteroid field for resource processing and docking stations. 4. **Ship Customization and Construction**: A simplified version where players can attach predefined modules to ships to alter their function (e.g. cargo hold for resources, weapon module for combat). 5. **Combat System**: A rudimentary combat system where players can engage in battles by ordering ships to attack enemy ships within range. 6. **Multiplayer Support**: Allow two or more players to log in to a shared server and interact with each other to test resource competition and combat. **Prototyping Steps:** 1. **Setup Game Environment**: - Launch the selected game engine and create a new project. - Set up a basic 3D space environment with a starry background and a non-collidable plane to serve as the baseline universe. 2. **Develop Navigation and Resource Collection**: - Program ship movements using basic controls and physics. - Create mineable asteroids and a mining mechanic controlled by player input. 3. **Implement Base Building**: - Allow players to place a skeletal space station on designated locations such as near asteroids. - Implement basic grid or snap-to placement systems to arrange station modules. 4. **Create Ship Customization**: - Design a simple interface for adding or removing modules to a ship. - Ensure that changes in modules affect ship behavior, such as increased cargo space or combat capabilities. 5. **Code Combat Mechanics**: - Develop simple AI for enemy ships that move and attack within range. - Add basic player-controlled ship combat using point-and-click to attack designated targets. 6. **Add Multiplayer Functionality**: - Set up a networking framework that allows multiple players to join the same game instance. - Synchronize player movements, actions, and interactions across the network. 7. **Testing and Iteration**: - Conduct internal playtests to identify bugs and ensure that the core mechanics are engaging. - Iterate based on feedback, refining and simplifying mechanics as needed. 8. **Documentation**: - Keep detailed notes and documentation for every aspect of the prototype to inform future development. The prototype won’t include advanced features such as diplomacy, a complex economy, or a tech tree; these would be developed in later stages after validating the fundamental gameplay. Keep in mind that the prototyping phase is exploratory and subject to change. Often, a feature that seems promising on paper doesn't work out in practice and may need to be rethought. The prototype should be flexible and easy to modify as you learn from players' interactions and feedback."},{"instruction":"Давай представим, что я путишественник во времени.

If you want to start a new conversation or a new line of code execution without re-running your entire model, you would typically follow this workflow: 1. **Ensure your model is saved**: If you have a machine learning model that has been trained, make sure you save the state of that model to disk so you can reload it without needing to retrain. \`\`\`python # Example of saving a model using Keras model.save('my_model.h5') # creates a HDF5 file 'my_model.h5' # Later, when you want to use the same model, load it: from tensorflow import keras model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5') \`\`\` 2. **Store intermediate results**: In case you need to use outcomes from earlier computations, make sure to store results in variables or on disk so they are accessible in subsequent cells. 3. **Start a new cell for a new conversation**: When you want to execute a new set of instructions or code, simply start a new cell. There's no need to rerun the entire notebook. You can start typing in a new cell and execute just that cell. For example: \`\`\`python # This could be your new conversation or new task print(\\"This is a new conversation\\") \`\`\` Press \`Shift + Enter\` or the \\"Play\\" button in the Colab interface to run just the new cell.

If they have not, you only need to re-run those specific prerequisite cells, not the entire notebook. Keep in mind that if you use the \\"Restart runtime\\" feature, you will lose all the variables and the state of the current environment, so in such cases, you would indeed have to rerun the cells that set things up.

You will basically frame it as a classification task, where the input is a line of text, and the output is the class (agent or user). 3. **Make Predictions**: After fine-tuning, use the model to make predictions on new text. For a new conversation paragraph, you would split this paragraph into separate lines, preprocess them in the same manner as the training data, input these lines into the BERT model, and get predictions for each line. Here's a high-level example of what the code might look like in Python. First, install transformers if you haven't already: \`\`\`python !pip install transformers \`\`\` Then, you can fine-tune a model using a library like Hugging Face's \`transformers\`. You would need to load the dataset, create a data loader, define your model, and train it: \`\`\`python from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments import pandas as pd # Load dataset df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv') # Preprocessing and creating a dataset object for Hugging Face goes here ... # Load tokenizer and model from Hugging Face tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased') model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2) # num_labels: agent, user # Define training arguments training_args = TrainingArguments( output_dir='./results', num_train_epochs=3, per_device_train_batch_size=16, per_device_eval_batch_size=16, warmup_steps=500, weight_decay=0.01, evaluate_during_training=True, ) # Initialize Trainer trainer = Trainer( model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=train_dataset, # you would define train_dataset eval_dataset=val_dataset # you would define val_dataset ) # Train the model trainer.train() \`\`\` After training, you need to handle the new conversation paragraph: \`\`\`python def classify_speaker(text): inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\\"pt\\", padding=True, truncation=True) outputs = model(**inputs) predictions = outputs.logits.argmax(-1) # Map predictions to labels return ['agent' if pred == 0 else 'user' for pred in predictions] conversation = \\"\\"\\" Hello.

This is a more complex task because it requires the model not only to classify but also to detect the boundaries between the change of speakers. To solve this problem, you would typically need a two-step approach: 1. **Dialogue Segmentation**: You'll need to segment the conversation into the different turns taken by each speaker. This could be done with rule-based methods if there are consistent patterns in the data, like specific greetings or signoffs, or with a machine learning model trained to detect turn-taking cues in the conversation. 2. **Speaker Classification**: Once the turns are segmented, you apply a model (like BERT) to classify each segment as belonging to an agent or a user. However, to train a model for dialogue segmentation, you need a labeled dataset that marks the boundaries of speaker turns. If you don't have such a dataset, you might resort to some heuristics; for example, you might try to use punctuation and keywords as a clue for potential turn changes. Considering you want to implement this on paragraphs without clear line breaks and use BERT for classification, let me provide you a high-level procedure. Some manual heuristics might be involved unless you build or have a model that can specifically segment conversations by turns. High-Level Procedure: 1. **Heuristic Segmentation**: You manually design rules to approximate where one speaker ends, and another begins. Punctuation such as periods, question marks, or specific phrases that might denote speaker changes could be used. This is very dataset-specific and has limitations but might be usable as a starting point. 2. **Fine-Tuning a Classification Model**: Assuming segmentation can be performed, you can then fine-tune BERT (or another suitable transformer model) on your labeled dataset from the CSV file, where each segment is tagged with the correct speaker. 3. **Applying the Model to New Paragraphs**: Use the heuristic segmentation on the new conversation paragraph to create segments. Pass these segments through the fine-tuned BERT model to classify each segment as 'agent' or 'user'. Here's a simplified example of how you might approach step 1 with Python's \`re\` module to split the dialogue based on some simple punctuation rules: \`\`\`python import re conversation = \\"Hello. Welcome, how are you today? I’m fine. I have a problem with the product I bought from your site this week. I'm sorry to hear that. I see. Ok, I see the size is written in the description but the product in the picture looks very big.\\" # Heuristic segmentation based on punctuation for example purposes segments = re.split(r'. |? ', conversation) # segments would look like this: # ['Hello', 'Welcome, how are you today', 'I’m fine', 'I have a problem with the product I bought from your site this week', \\"I'm sorry to hear that\\", 'I see', ... ] \`\`\` This approach has obvious drawbacks as it splits purely based on punctuation, without understanding the context or the flow of the conversation. For a more refined approach, assuming you have sufficiently labeled dialogue turn data, you would build a machine learning model for dialogue segmentation or use an existing natural language understanding model capable of identifying speaker turns, something that might involve sequence modeling and could be quite complex. After segmentation, you then use your pre-trained BERT model (fine-tuned on your labeled conversations) to classify each segment as mentioned in the earlier response. Please note that each language model has a maximum token length, typically 512 tokens for BERT, which you need to consider when segmenting the inputs. This task should be approached iteratively, starting with simple heuristics to refine your segmentation and classification, and potentially moving on to more complex machine learning models if your problem and dataset require it."},{"instruction":"give me a complete python code for this.","output":"Creating a full solution for this complex task is beyond the scope of a single response, but I can guide you through the process with a high-level code example. Assuming we are relying on simple heuristics for segmentation and using a pre-trained model for classification, you would need to take the following steps to develop a working solution: 1. Load and preprocess the dataset. 2. Fine-tune a BERT model on the preprocessed dataset. 3. Use a heuristic-based approach to segment the test text into probable dialogue turns. 4. Classify each segment as 'agent' or 'user'. Below is a high-level, incomplete example of a Python script. This example assumes that you already have a dataset prepared and a fine-tuned BERT model ready for classification, which are both non-trivial tasks. \`\`\`python import re from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification import torch # Assuming you have a fine-tuned model; for a real application, you would load your own fine-tuned model. model_name = 'your-fine-tuned-model' tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name) model.eval() # Inference mode def heuristic_segmentation(text): # Splits the conversation at any occurrence of a period followed by a space # or a question mark followed by a space.

Remember, this example is greatly simplified and omits many steps, such as error checking, handling edge cases, ensuring the GPU/CPU device compatibility, and dealing with longer conversations that might exceed token limits. Fine-tuning BERT and handling context in conversation require careful preprocessing and model training, and [Hugging Face's documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html) is an excellent resource to get started on that. Implementing a robust speaker classification system is a challenging task that might require custom model development and extensive training on labeled conversational data. The heuristics for segmentation should also be carefully designed to fit the nuances of the specific dialogue patterns present in the data."},{"instruction":"give me the complete code line by line or give me the parts so that I can ask you to print each part in later prompts","output":"Due to the complexity of the task and limitations in space and interactivity, it is challenging to provide a complete, robust, and fully functioning Python script that satisfies all aspects of the task within a single prompt.

Here I'll assume that you already have a fine-tuned BERT model ready for classifying dialogue segments, possibly stored at \`'your-fine-tuned-model'\`. # Step 1: Load Necessary Libraries \`\`\`python import re from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification import torch \`\`\` # Step 2: Load Pre-Trained Tokenizer and Model \`\`\`python # You would have to replace 'bert-base-uncased' with your actual fine-tuned model path model_name = 'bert-base-uncased' tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name) model.eval() # inference mode \`\`\` # Step 3: Define Function for Heuristic Segmentation \`\`\`python def heuristic_segmentation(text): # This regex is overly simplistic and may need to be improved segments = re.split(r'(?<!w.w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z].)(?<=.|?)s', text) return segments \`\`\` # Step 4: Define Function for Classifying Speaker \`\`\`python def classify_speaker(segments): speaker_labels = [] for segment in segments: inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(segment, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512) with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model(**inputs) prediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1).item() label = 'agent' if prediction == 0 else 'user' # Modify based on your labels speaker_labels.append(label) return speaker_labels \`\`\` # Step 5: Full Example to Process a Conversation \`\`\`python # An example conversation conversation = \\"Welcome to support. How can I assist you? I have a problem. My device won't start.\\" # Using the heuristic_segmentation function defined segments = heuristic_segmentation(conversation) # Use the classify_speaker function to classify each segment based on the fine-tuned model speaker_labels = classify_speaker(segments) # Output the classified conversation for segment, label in zip(segments, speaker_labels): print(f\\"{label.upper()}: {segment}\\") \`\`\` # Step 6: Execution of the Complete Code This step is where you run your entire script in your Python environment. You need to combine the above snippets in the correct order to generate a fully functional implementation matching your use case. Please remember that each snippet here is an illustration and that you will need to fine-tune and adjust each based on your dataset and requirements. If you require fine-tuning of the model with your dataset, that would involve further extensive code, including use of a dataset, defining loss, optimization, and evaluation, not covered in these snippets. These sample snippets assume you are using a GPU if available, as BERT models can be resource-intensive. If you are working on a machine without a GPU, you may need to configure the snippets to ensure they use the CPU by explicitly specifying device allocation with PyTorch."},{"instruction":"i am using cpu . and now give me the complete code for step 1","output":"Certainly! In Step 1, we will import all the necessary libraries for our script. Since we'll be using Hugging Face's \`transformers\` library, we'll need to ensure that it is installed in our environment.

Then we will import the required modules from those libraries, as well as other necessary Python modules for this task. Here's the complete code for Step 1: \`\`\`python # Step 1: Load Necessary Libraries # Make sure to install these first using pip if needed: # !pip install transformers torch import re import torch from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification # Check and use a CPU device for inference if torch.cuda.is_available(): device = torch.device(\\"cuda\\") print(\\"Using GPU:\\", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)) else: device = torch.device(\\"cpu\\") print(\\"Using CPU\\") \`\`\` This code ensures that the script checks for available devices and sets up to use a CPU if that's what is available.

If you haven't already installed the \`transformers\` package or PyTorch and you encounter an error, then you should install them using pip. Uncomment the pip install commands provided and run them before executing the rest of the code.

When integrating into a full script, you will have to make sure that the model and tokenizer names or paths match those of the models you have available, and if you're fine-tuning the model on your dataset, you'll need to provide the path to that fine-tuned model instead of the default \`'bert-base-uncased'\`.

Such models often operate in environments where the data is either too large to fit in memory or is arriving in real time (streaming data). In the context of natural language processing tasks like question answering (QA), a model might need to search through a large database or continuously ingesting data to find the best possible answer to a question. Processing streaming data in a RetrievalQA system would involve the following high-level steps: 1. Monitoring a data stream for new entries. 2. Extracting relevant information from each entry. 3. A retrieval system that queries a knowledge base or database with information extracted from the stream. 4. A QA system using the retrieved documents to answer questions. To set up a simplified version of RetrievalQA for streaming data, you would need to: - Set up a streaming data source. - Preprocess and index the data using a method suitable for retrieval (e.g., Elasticsearch, FAISS). - Query the indexed data for potential answers to questions posed. - Use a QA model or some algorithm to extract the answer from the retrieved documents. Below is a very simplified Python example of how you might set up a retrieval system for a static dataset using Elasticsearch. It doesn't handle streaming data directly, but can give you an idea of how to start with retrieval systems: \`\`\`python from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch from elasticsearch.helpers import bulk # Connect to Elasticsearch server (assuming it's running locally on the default port) es = Elasticsearch() # Indexing a list of documents (you would have this in your streaming data processing function) def index_documents(documents): actions = [ { '_index': 'qna-index', # Name of the index '_type': 'document', '_source': { 'document_text': doc } } for doc in documents ] bulk(es, actions) # Function to search documents using a query (your question) def search_index(query): body = { 'query': { 'match': { 'document_text': query } } } res = es.search(index='qna-index', body=body) return res['hits']['hits'] # You would update the documents dynamically as stream data is received. documents = [\\"Elasticsearch is a search engine\\", \\"Machine learning can create models\\", \\"Python is a programming language\\"] index_documents(documents) # Simulate asking a question question = \\"What is a search engine?\\" results = search_index(question) # Process results for result in results: print(result['_source']['document_text']) \`\`\` In a streaming context, you might use a framework like Apache Kafka or other message queue systems for the streaming aspect. The retrieval system will listen to the stream, indexing data as it comes, and there would be another component responsible for issuing queries to the retrieval system based on incoming questions. Please note that this example code is for purposes of illustration only. A real-world RetrievalQA system handling streaming data would be significantly more complex, requiring a detailed setup and possibly combining multiple components such as an inverted index for lookup, a real-time update mechanism, a sophisticated ranking system, and a machine learning model to provide the final answers."},{"instruction":"Write 50 ai art prompts similar to the following with changing the part in the brackets to different ideas : Ink scribbles sketch on a sketchbook colored by watercolors of Belal, a young man with short black curly buzz cut hair, full short beard and hazel eyes, bushy eyebrows, wearing a white coat labelled Dr Belal .

In the context of machine learning, diffusion models have recently gained attention as generative models for creating high-quality data samples, such as images, audio, and text. Here, I will describe the diffusion process in the context of generative machine learning models. The diffusion model in machine learning, particularly in the context of deep learning, is based on the idea of gradually adding noise to the data to create a random noise distribution, and then learning to reverse this process to generate data from noise. This type of model is known as a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). The process can be broadly divided into two phases: the forward diffusion process (also called the noising process) and the reverse diffusion process (also called the denoising process). 1. **Forward Diffusion Process**: - Begin with your original data distribution (e.g., a set of images). - Sequentially add Gaussian noise to the original data through a series of time-steps or stages, following a Markov chain. At each time step, the data becomes noisier, moving away from the original data distribution towards a distribution of pure noise (e.g., a Gaussian distribution). - This process is described by a sequence of probability distributions that smoothly transitions from the data distribution to the noise distribution. The parameters of the Gaussian noise can be designed to gradually increase in variance with each step. 2. **Reverse Diffusion Process**: - The goal here is to learn the reverse of the forward process: starting from noise, progressively remove the noise, and reconstruct the original data distribution. - A neural network, often a deep neural network like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is trained to predict the noise that was added at each step of the forward process. By predicting and subtracting this noise, the model reconstructs the signal (denoises). - Training involves adjusting the parameters of the network to minimize differences between the predicted clean data and the actual clean data from earlier in the forward process. The training leverages a form of variational inference, which makes the problem more tractable and allows the model to learn complex data distributions. The advantage of diffusion models is that they can often generate very high-quality and diverse samples that capture the complexities of the data distribution they've been trained on. Diffusion models have been applied in areas such as computer vision for image synthesis, natural language processing for text generation, and even in creating audio waveforms. They are known for producing results that are comparable to or better than other state-of-the-art generative models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)."},{"instruction":"How can I write a propagation minus one algorithm in haskell?","output":"Propagation Minus One (PM1) is a term that's not regularly used in algorithmic contexts and might be related to specific fields like cellular automata, genetic algorithms, or elsewhere. However, I'll assume you are referring to a generic concept where you want to propagate some value through a structure, decrementing it by one at each step. Since the term is not standard, I'll demonstrate a simple recursive algorithm that could fit the description of a \\"propagation minus one\\" process using a list as an example structure in Haskell. Let's say we want to propagate a value through a list of integers, decrementing the value by one at each step, and excluding any positions that reach below zero. Here's how you could write it: \`\`\`haskell -- The PM1 algorithm applied to a list where the propagation stops if the value reaches below one. propagateMinusOne :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int] propagateMinusOne _ [] = [] -- propagation ends when the list is empty propagateMinusOne x (y:ys) | x > 0 = (x + y) : propagateMinusOne (x - 1) ys -- add to current and propagate to the rest | otherwise = y : propagateMinusOne x ys -- do not add to current if x is not positive main :: IO () main = do -- Replace \`startValue\` and \`inputList\` with the initial decrementing value and the input list, respectively let startValue = 5 let inputList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -- Call \`propagateMinusOne\` and print the result print propagateMinusOne startValue inputList -- Expected output with startValue = 5: [6,6,5,4,3] \`\`\` This Haskell code defines a function \`propagateMinusOne\` that takes an initial integer and decrements it by one at each recursive call while adding the decremented value to the corresponding element in the list.

The season closes on a bittersweet note, showcasing the impact individuals can have on the course of time and the enduring human spirit that drives them to strive for a place they can call their own time. Whether they find their way back to their timeline or are forever a part of history's fabric remains an open question, with the potential for their journey to continue in another season or a finale where they must accept their role as travelers forever stitching together the tapestry of time."},{"instruction":"Season 4 : They crash out of the tunell into a verdant forest.. it's seemingy the early Bronze age, and they might be stuck for good this time, but there are signs of out of place relics of their own time in 2023..","output":"Title: \\"Temporal Junction: Season 4\\" **Episode 1: “Green Epoch”** The travelers, battered by their temporal ordeal, emerge from the tunnel into an unexpected landscape: a lush forest unspoiled by modernity. The train, their faithful vessel through time, is no more—just a twisted wreckage that fades as if it never was, leaving them stranded in what appears to be the early Bronze Age. Confronted with the need to survive in a time when humanity is sparse and scattered, the group must rely on their collective knowledge to make fire, construct shelter, and hunt or gather food. The band, which once played electric guitars, now crafts crude instruments from wood and string, providing comfort in music that transcends the ages. **Episode 2: “Artifacts of Anachronism”** As they acclimate to their new/old world, the travelers begin to notice signs of incongruity: artifacts and relics from 2023 are scattered throughout the forest, rusted and overgrown. This revelation sparks a glimmer of hope that there might be a way back, or at the very least, that others have traveled this path before them. The history teacher, interpreting the artifacts as a breadcrumb trail left by time's fickle currents, persuades the group to search for more clues. The scientist, though despondent at their seemingly impossible predicament, can't resist the urge to uncover the reasons behind these temporal anomalies. **Episode 3: “Echoes of Civilization”** Amid the struggle for daily survival, the group encounters a tribe of early Bronze Age people. The meeting is tense but curiosity prevails over fear. Our characters are regarded with a mixture of awe and suspicion, seen as otherworldly beings due to their strange clothes and knowledge.

Moments of humor and humanity shine through as both groups learn from each other, with the travelers introducing basic hygiene and medical practices while learning ancient survival skills. **Episode 4: “Chronos' Relics”** The investigation into the artifacts from their own time intensifies. The scientist theorizes that the presence of such items could indicate a kind of \\"temporal dumpsite,\\" where objects from various eras are pulled into the past during unstable time events. Meanwhile, the band members, using their new primitive instruments, introduce rhythms reminiscent of future music, creating a cultural exchange that hints at the universality of art and emotion. As the group increasingly integrates with the local people, they face the moral implications of influencing a developing culture with ideas and knowledge from a distant future. **Episode 5: “Temporal Fabric”** As the seasons change, so do the travelers' prospects. Understanding the region’s flora and fauna, they begin to thrive, with some even finding contentment in this simpler existence. However, when a flash flood unearths an object undeniably modern—a broken digital device—the group's resolve to uncover the truth behind their journey is reignited. They now theorize that something or someone in their original timeline is causing these anomalies. The historian suggests they may be dealing with a time paradox—a self-fulfilling prophecy where their attempts to go back in time cause the artifacts to appear in the Bronze Age, perpetuating the cycle of events that led them here. **Episode 6: “Bridges of Time”** The group sets to work, with the scientist leading an effort to MacGyver a device from the artifacts that could potentially signal through time. A sense of camaraderie and kinship has formed among them and the Bronze Age tribe, who now partially understand that these strangers are from a distant 'elsewhen.' Throughout these trials, the elderly couple who have struggled the most with constant movement through time, now become the heart and moral compass of the group, advising prudence in how much they should intervene or reveal about the future. **Episode 7: “Shadows and Runestones”** An unexpected celestial event—a solar eclipse—provides what the scientist believes could be a natural surge of energy to power their signal device. They must now race against time to complete their project as the celestial clock counts down. The travelers reflect on their cumulative impact on the tribe and the moral complexities of their situation, debating whether to leave behind a legacy of knowledge or to minimize their footprint on this nascent society. During these discussions, the history and potential of humanity are ruminated upon—how far it has come and where it may be heading. **Episode 8: “Alignment”** As the eclipse approaches, the tribe is abuzz with a mix of fear and excitement, having incorporated the travelers into a prophetic vision of gods and time-altering omens. The travelers successfully activate their strange, cobbled-together technology during the eclipse's peak, causing a sensory spectacle that further cements their mythical status within the tribe. The screen fades to white as they activate the device, leaving their fate uncertain. Have they finally found a way back to their own time? Have they triggered yet another series of unpredictable jumps through history? Or have they accepted their roles as inadvertent shapers of human history? The season ends on an open-ended question, with potential for the series to explore more philosophical themes regarding human existence, the persistent quest for knowledge, and our interconnectedness across the expanse of time.

We need to count these cases separately and then sum them up. **Case 1: Each digit appears exactly twice.** We have to choose 3 different digits out of 10 (0-9), and since the number is 6-digit, it cannot start with 0. This case involves two steps: 1. Choosing which 3 digits to use. 2. Arranging these digits in a 6-digit number. Step 1: We have 9 choices for the first digit (any non-zero digit) and then we can choose the other two from the remaining 9 digits in ( binom{9}{2} ) ways. So, the number of ways to choose the digits is ( 9 times binom{9}{2} ). Step 2: Once the digits are chosen, we need to arrange them in such a way that each is used twice in the 6-digit number. This is equivalent to arranging 6 items where there are 2 of three different types. We can use the multinomial coefficient here: ( frac{6!}{2! cdot 2! cdot 2!} ), which is the number of ways to arrange 6 objects where duplicates of three types exist. The total for Case 1 is therefore: ( 9 times binom{9}{2} times frac{6!}{2! cdot 2! cdot 2!} ). **Case 2: One digit appears three times, another appears twice, and the third appears once.** Again, we'll follow two steps similar to the first case: Step 1: We must select which 3 digits to use, but we need to account for each digit's role. First, we choose the non-zero digit to appear three times (9 choices). Then we can choose the remaining two digits (one which will appear twice and one which will appear once) from the remaining 9 digits in ( binom{9}{2} ) ways. So, the number of choices here is ( 9 times binom{9}{2} ). Step 2: Now we need to arrange the one digit that appears three times, the second that appears twice, and the third that appears once. We can use the multinomial coefficient: ( frac{6!}{3! cdot 2! cdot 1!} ), which is the number of arrangements of 6 items with duplicates of three types. The total for Case 2 is therefore: ( 9 times binom{9}{2} times frac{6!}{3! cdot 2! cdot 1!} ). Now we add the totals for both cases: Total = ( left( 9 times binom{9}{2} times frac{6!}{2! cdot 2! cdot 2!} right) + left( 9 times binom{9}{2} times frac{6!}{3! cdot 2! cdot 1!} right) ). Let's calculate this. The binomial coefficient ( binom{9}{2} ) is ( frac{9 times 8}{2 times 1} = 36 ) and ( 6! ) is ( 720 ). For Case 1: ( 9 times 36 times frac{720}{8} = 9 times 36 times 90 = 29160 ). For Case 2: ( 9 times 36 times frac{720}{12} = 9 times 36 times 60 = 19440 ). Adding both cases gives us: 29160 (Case 1) + 19440 (Case 2) = 48600.

Это очень важный вопрос, ведь от профессионализма и компетентности врача зависит ваше здоровье и благополучие. Первое, на что следует обратить внимание при выборе врача – это его квалификация. Проверьте образование врача, его опыт работы, наличие сертификатов и прочих квалификационных документов. Это поможет понять, насколько врач компетентен в своей области. Второе важное качество – это эмпатия и внимательное отношение к пациентам. Хороший врач должен проявлять интерес к вашим проблемам, слушать вас внимательно, давать исчерпывающие ответы на ваши вопросы и поддерживать вас во время лечения. Также, не менее важно обращать внимание на репутацию врача. Посмотрите отзывы других пациентов о данном специалисте, узнайте его рейтинг и репутацию среди коллег. Это поможет вам понять, насколько врач надежен и профессионален. И, конечно же, не забывайте о личной химии между вами и врачом. Важно, чтобы вы чувствовали себя комфортно и доверяли специалисту, который заботится о вашем здоровье.

Вот несколько шагов, которые вы можете предпринять, если ваш квадрокоптер теряет сигнал спутниковой навигации: 1. Сохраняйте спокойствие: Поддаваться панике только усугубит ситуацию. Держите контроллер в руках и будьте готовы перейти к ручному управлению. 2. Переключитесь на ручное управление: Большинство квадрокоптеров позволяют вам переключаться между автоматическими режимами полета и ручным (или аттитюдным) управлением. Если вы имеете опыт ручного пилотирования, переключитесь на этот режим, чтобы взять контроль над дроном. 3. Используйте функции безопасности: Некоторые квадрокоптеры имеют встроенные функции безопасности, например возврат домой (Return-to-Home или RTH), который активируется при потере сигнала. Если ваша модель поддерживает такую функцию, убедитесь, что она активирована. 4. Наблюдайте за дроном: Следите за его поведением. Если квадрокоптер начал вести себя непредсказуемо или кажется, что он ведет себя аномально, быть может, лучше будет выполнить принудительную посадку. 5. Принудительная посадка: Если вы больше не уверены в безопасности продолжения полета, найдите открытое место и постарайтесь аккуратно посадить дрон. Обратите внимание на окружающие препятствия и безопасность людей на земле. 6. Анализируйте причины потери сигнала: После безопасного возвращения дрона обязательно проанализируйте, почему произошел обрыв связи. Это могло быть из-за помех, погодных условий или даже технических неисправностей. Обновите прошивку квадрокоптера, проверьте настройки и устраните возможные источники помех. 7. Читайте инструкцию: У разных моделей квадрокоптеров могут быть разные процедуры при потере сигнала. Ознакомьтесь с руководством пользователя, чтобы узнать рекомендации производителя. 8. Тренируйтесь: Регулярно тренируйтесь управлять дроном в различных условиях, включая полет без GPS. Это поможет вам чувствовать себя увереннее и реагировать адекватно в случае потери сигнала во время полета. 9. Соблюдайте правила безопасности: Всегда летайте в зонах, где это разрешено, и не подвергайте опасности людей и имущество. Полеты в близи мест с высоким уровнем интерференции или помех для радио- и сигналов спутниковой навигации могут быть рискованными. Помните, что безопасность должна быть на первом месте. Если вы не уверены в своих способностях управлять беспилотником без помощи спутниковой навигации, лучше не рискуйте и проводите полеты в безопасной среде с уверенным сигналом GNSS."},{"instruction":"Переформулируй техническим языком: Проверить качество подключения антенной системы","output":"Осуществить диагностику интегритета антенного модуля и уровня качества соединения интерфейса радиочастотного передатчика с приемопередающей антенной."},{"instruction":"Переформулируй : Проверить качество подключения антенной системы","output":"Выполнить техническую инспекцию и оценку параметров соединения антенной системы для обеспечения соответствия номинальной производительности и эффективности сигнальной связи."},{"instruction":"si en un proyecto en pycharm tengo dos pestañas .py abiertas, y hago shift f10 siempre me ejecuta una, como ejecuto la otra?","output":"PyCharm determina la configuración de ejecución (o Run Configuration) a utilizar cuando presionas Shift+F10.

Esistono due principali tipi di tumore al polmone: il carcinoma polmonare non a piccole cellule (NSCLC) e il carcinoma polmonare a piccole cellule (SCLC), che hanno approcci terapeutici differenziati. Ecco un riepilogo delle opzioni di trattamento principali: **1. Chirurgia:** Per i pazienti con NSCLC in stadio precoce e una buona funzione polmonare, la chirurgia può essere l'opzione migliore. Questo può includere una lobectomia (rimozione di un lobo del polmone), una pneumonectomia (rimozione dell'intero polmone), o resezioni meno estese. **2. Radioterapia:** Utilizza radiazioni ad alta energia per uccidere le cellule tumorali. Può essere utilizzata da sola nei pazienti che non sono in grado di sottoporsi a chirurgia, o in combinazione con la chirurgia per eliminare eventuali residui di cellule tumorali. **3. Chemioterapia:** Impiega farmaci per uccidere le cellule tumorali o fermarne la crescita. Può essere usata dopo la chirurgia per eliminare le cellule cancerose rimanenti (chemioterapia adiuvante), prima della chirurgia per ridurre il tumore (chemioterapia neo-adiuvante), o come trattamento primario in stadi più avanzati. **4. Terapie mirate:** Farmaci o altre sostanze che bloccano la crescita e la diffusione del cancro interferendo con specifiche molecole coinvolte nel processo di crescita e progressione del tumore. Questi trattamenti sono spesso utilizzati per i NSCLC avanzati che presentano specifiche alterazioni genetiche. **5. Immunoterapia:** Questo tipo di trattamento stimola il sistema immunitario del proprio corpo per combattere il cancro. Sono disponibili diversi agenti di immunoterapia per il trattamento del cancro del polmone, in particolare per i NSCLC avanzati. **6. Trattamenti adiuvanti e palliativi:** Questi includono i trattamenti per alleviare i sintomi e migliorare la qualità della vita, come la gestione del dolore, il trattamento delle complicanze come le infezioni respiratorie, e il supporto nutrizionale e psicologico. È importante notare che per il carcinoma polmonare a piccole cellule, la chemioterapia e la radioterapia sono le principali forme di trattamento, dato che questo tipo di tumore è generalmente diffuso già al momento della diagnosi e di solito non è operabile. La scelta del trattamento è complessa e fatta su misura per ogni paziente. Il processo di decisione deve coinvolgere un team multidisciplinare di specialisti, tra cui oncologi, chirurghi toracici, radioterapisti, patologi e altri, così come il paziente e la sua famiglia, per garantire che tutte le opzioni siano considerate e che il piano di trattamento sia adattato alle esigenze individuali del paziente."},{"instruction":"quiero crear una lista de reproducción en youtube con videos short sobre la historia de la antigua esparta, me entiendes?, responde solo si o no.","output":"Sí."},{"instruction":"dame un listado de los titulos de al menos 3 videos ordenados cronologicamente, incluyendo personajes importantes.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Also add a set of insecurity stats that start at 0, but exponentially rises as I regress and my confidence is waning, which affects my showmanship. When I become younger in age than Lily, my insecurity stats automatically double. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Enchantment Arena, where aspiring mages match wits and grace in the art of magic dueling.

Since then, the response from the community has been overwhelming, and we've been fueled by the invaluable insights gained from user experiences. Today, we're thrilled to announce FireFunction-v1, our new & improved, open-weights model, based on Mixtral. Try out the new model here! We have packed in a significant amount of improvements over our last version of the function calling model - fw-function-call-34b-v0. Some highlights of the new model include Highest quality for real-world use cases - We’ve optimized performance for structured output generation & routing decision-making. Decision-making is made even better through a new option to configure “tool_choice” to ‘any’ to force a function call. Improved response accuracy for multilingual inputs. Based on one of the highest quality OSS models - Mixtral 8x7B. Available open-weights or hosted with blazing-fast speeds on the Fireworks platform Compared to GPT4, FireFunction provides similar accuracy on real-world use cases with significantly faster speeds and the flexibility of open-source. Based on internal evaluations, FireFunction achieves significant quality & speed improvements over other OSS-based function calling model providers.

Function calling is the ability of a model to output information to call external APIs. LLMs have immense utility on their own but cannot access real-time or internal data. Function calling bridges that gap by letting LLMs format text to call APIs and optionally incorporate the API response. This enables use cases like dynamic agents. For example, you could have a scheduling agent that can check the weather through API and change plans based on the result. Use Cases Structured Output Our previous function calling model faced difficulty dealing with nested function specifications and dealing with complex output data types such as arrays, dictionaries etc. We have enhanced the ability of FireFunction to follow complicated JSON Spec now. The model is aided in this task by our recent launch of general JSON mode support. We bring the best of two worlds together (1) Using the function calling model to make the right decisions about data format to choose & what parameter values to populate and (2) Using JSON mode to force the model to always generate the correctly formatted JSON. All of the improvements greatly improve the accuracy of making correct, well-formatted function calls. For example, let’s say you wanted the model to call a Stripe-like API that always requires the following properties: { \\"name\\": \\"createPayment\\", \\"description\\": \\"Create a new payment request\\", \\"parameters\\": { \\"type\\": \\"object\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"transaction_amount\\": { \\"type\\": \\"number\\", \\"description\\": \\"The amount to be paid\\" }, \\"description\\": { \\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"description\\": \\"A brief description of the payment\\" }, \\"payment_method_id\\": { \\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"description\\": \\"The payment method to be used\\" }, \\"payer\\": { \\"type\\": \\"object\\", \\"description\\": \\"Information about the payer, including their name, email, and identification number\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"name\\": { \\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"description\\": \\"The payer's name\\" }, \\"email\\": { \\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"description\\": \\"The payer's email address\\" }, \\"identification\\": { \\"type\\": \\"object\\", \\"description\\": \\"The payer's identification number\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"type\\": { \\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"description\\": \\"The type of identification document (e.g. CPF, CNPJ)\\" }, \\"number\\": { \\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"description\\": \\"The identification number\\" } }, \\"required\\": [ \\"type\\", \\"number\\" ] } }, \\"required\\": [ \\"name\\", \\"email\\", \\"identification\\" ] } } } } You could feed text into the FireFunction model, such as a user conversation, and the model would always adhere to the provided structure so that it’s more likely to make valid API calls. Another potential use case of the structured response mode is in not calling APIs but in providing structured output. For example, let’s say you wanted to extract structured data from animal articles to easily add to a database. You could specify output for the firefunction model to be attributes from all articles like the “animal weight” and “animal habitat”. Then you can run articles through firefunction and ensure that info is always extracted in the specified format. See examples of both of these use cases in this example notebook! Routing Decision-Making One of the most important use cases for function that we’ve heard is in decision-making and routing. Inputs to LLMs apps are often dynamic and different inputs could spur different optimal reactions. For example, consider an application for a financial assistant that takes a user command to get more information. Depending on the user command, we may want to call a function to get stock price or a different function to get news. The model must be able to parse user input and choose between these couple functions. __See the model in action choosing between 4 different functions in our UI demo (screenshot below). Our model is designed for exceptional accuracy across many functions. We present the result of our model on 2 benchmarks - evaluating the function calling ability of short context (choose between 5 functions), and long context (choose between 10 functions). For evaluation, we use a dataset released by the Nexus team. We’d also like to thank the Nexus team for creating a high-quality dataset! In the evaluations, we use function calling mode for all the available models, except the prompt-engineered Mixtral Instruct model. For the prompt-engineered Mixtral Instruct model, we use JSON mode to keep the comparison fair. For comparison with GPT-4, we use gpt-4-0125-preview. We don’t train on any of the evaluation datasets. The short-function context accuracy eval was run on Nexus OTX dataset, which contains 5 input functions. Figure 1: The chart displays the accuracy of firefunction-v1 compared to other models. Higher is better. Going from v0 to v1, we observe around 4% jump in accuracy and on-par accuracy with GPT-4. For long-function context accuracy, we use the Nexus VT dataset which contains 10 input functions. Figure 2: The chart displays the accuracy of firefunction-v1 compared to other models. Higher is better. Most notably the firefunction-v1 closes the gap to latest GPT-4 turbo from 14% to under 5%. “Any” parameter - In many decision-making use cases, we always want the model to make a function call and may never want the model to respond with just its internal knowledge. For example, if you’re routing between multiple models specialized at different tasks (multilingual input, math, etc), you may use the function-calling model to always send requests to one of the models and never respond independently. Current function calling models don’t enable users to “force function calls”. For example, OpenAI provides two options for “tool_choice” (1) “Auto” - which risks having the model respond without an API call and (2) “Function_name”- which makes the model always choose the specified function. Firefunction v1 supports a new parameter value of “any” to always force the model to make a function call. The model can choose between any of the provided functions, but must always call a function. Blazing fast speed without quality sacrifices Especially for use cases like decision-making and model routing, we know that speed matters greatly. Users don’t want to wait for output as a model routes queries and calls APIs. Compared to GPT4, our model especially performs well in speed, despite maintaining a comparable quality to GPT-4. Our Mixtral-based model is served at the industry-leading inference speeds as other featured Fireworks models. Users can expect 4X speedups compared to GPT-4 Turbo. Figure 3: The chart highlights latency distribution given output token length distribution. We divide responses into 2 categories - < 50 and > 50. In both scenarios, we observe around 4X faster response times compared to GPT-4. Using the Function Calling Models The FireFunction models checkpoints are available on Hugging Face. We host FireFunction on Fireworks platform in a speed-optimized setup with OpenAI-compatible API. So you should be able to easily swap in our model with a 1-line code change if you were previously using OpenAI. The models are free to use while they’re in our limited beta period!

So, if you ask it something that needs outside information, it knows whether to look it up, ask another specialized robot, or do some other fancy robotic process. 4. **It Speaks Your Language:** It now understands and can reply accurately in multiple languages better than before. 5. **Cost:** They're letting folks use this new robot for free while they're still testing it out, but only for a limited time. **What's All This Function Calling Business?** Function calling is essentially a fancy term for when your smart robot friend asks other robots (APIs) for help to get or do something it can't do on its own. For instance, if you wanted to check the weather, the robot doesn't know it offhand, so it asks a weather robot, gets the info, and tells you if you need an umbrella or sunglasses for the day. **Why Do You Care?** The updates are great for people who make apps and other digital tools because it allows them to build smarter and faster things for you to use. Imagine a chat app where you type in a question about the weather, your planned trip, or wanting to create a reminder, and the app, powered by this super-fast robot friend, helps you almost instantly. **How Good Is It?** They did some tests to see how accurate and quick the robot is when doing its tasks, especially when compared to other smart robots out there. The results look good – it does the job almost as well as the best ones in the market, and much faster! **In Summary:** FireFunction V1 is the new, speedy, and smart robot upgrade from Fireworks that can do things quicker than before, work with different languages, and it's letting everyone peek at how it's built. It's like a genius helper that's becoming more helpful, and for developers and users, it means better, faster, and smarter tools in their digital lives. Plus, you can try it for free for a while!"},{"instruction":"What does the following mean exactly? :\\"\\" We host FireFunction on Fireworks platform in a speed-optimized setup with OpenAI-compatible API. So you should be able to easily swap in our model with a 1-line code change if you were previously using OpenAI. \\"\\"","output":"Sure, I'll explain that part to you: Hosting FireFunction on the Fireworks platform in a speed-optimized setup means that the company Fireworks has placed their new robot friend (the FireFunction program) in a special environment where it can work really fast. They've set everything up on their own computers and servers (which is what 'hosting' refers to) so that anyone using it can get their tasks done quickly. The \\"OpenAI-compatible API\\" part is like saying this FireFunction robot speaks the same language as another popular robot from OpenAI (the company behind GPT-3 and GPT-4). An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules that allows different software programs to communicate with each other. So if you've been using the OpenAI robot, you can easily switch to using the FireFunction robot without having to learn a whole new set of commands; it understands the same instructions. Finally, \\"easily swap in our model with a 1-line code change if you were previously using OpenAI\\" means that if a developer was using OpenAI's robot for their app or service, they can switch to FireFunction's robot by changing just one line of the computer code. It's like unplugging a lamp (OpenAI's robot) and plugging in a different, but compatible, lamp (FireFunction's robot) to get the same (or better) light with very little effort."},{"instruction":"This is my performance metrics {'Area': 3.2104190437614856e-11, 'PowerDissipation': 0.0393065, 'SlewRate': 2.7893815216964812, 'Gain': -44.9189, 'Bandwidth3dB': 605665.0, 'UnityGainFreq': 0.0, 'PhaseMargin': 0.0} which is represented in np.array as \\"current_metrics [ 3.21041904e-11 3.93065000e-02 2.78938152e+00 -4.49189000e+01 6.05665000e+05 0.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00]\\" and the previous performance metrics in np.array is \\"previous_metrics [ 1.38286424e-10 5.20160000e-02 8.00424115e+00 -6.07324000e+01 0.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00 0.00000000e+00]\\" I am using the below code in my RL algorithm to achieve my optimized values, in my process, I need to achieve the '7' performance metrics 'area', 'power dissipation', 'DC gain', 'Slew rate', 'Bandwidth3dB', 'Unity gain bandwidth', and 'Phase margin' with in the target performance metrics 'PERFORMANCE_METRICS_TARGET_LOW', 'PERFORMANCE_METRICS_TARGET_HIGH'.

Here's a breakdown of the code: 1. \`penalty_count = sum(1 for region in transistor_regions.values() if region != 2)\`: - This line constructs a generator expression that iterates over each value in the \`transistor_regions\` dictionary (which presumably represents the operating regions of transistors in the circuit). - For every transistor (\`region\`) which is not in region 2 (\`if region != 2\`), the expression yields a \`1\`. - The \`sum()\` function then totals all the \`1\`s yielded by the generator expression, effectively counting how many transistors are not in region 2. - The result is assigned to the variable \`penalty_count\`. 2. \`rewards_count -= self.LARGE_PENALTY * penalty_count\`: - This line deducts a penalty from \`rewards_count\`, which represents the overall reward for the current state of the circuit in the reinforcement learning environment. - The penalty is calculated by multiplying the \`self.LARGE_PENALTY\` (a predefined attribute representing the penalty value for a single transistor not being in region 2) by the \`penalty_count\` (the number of transistors not in region 2 from the previous step). - The subtraction assignment operator \`-=\` is used to reduce the \`rewards_count\` by this penalty amount. In summary, this piece of code is meant to discourage the reinforcement learning algorithm from ending up with a circuit state in which any of the transistors are not in their saturation region, by penalizing such occurrences. The more transistors there are out of saturation, the larger the penalty subtracted from the reward count, increasing the incentive for finding a circuit configuration where all transistors are in saturation."},{"instruction":"For my requirement, If the performance metrics is not in target and not improving or transistors moving away from saturation.

The first condition (\`elif not performance_metrics_in_target: if num_better == 0 or not all_in_saturation:\`) applies a penalty when any of the following are true: - No metrics have improved (\`num_better == 0\`), regardless of the saturation state. - Not all transistors are in saturation (\`not all_in_saturation\`), regardless of whether some metrics have improved. 2. The second condition (\`elif not performance_metrics_in_target: if num_better == 0 and not all_in_saturation:\`) only applies the penalty when both of the following are true simultaneously: - No metrics have improved (\`num_better == 0\`), and - Not all transistors are in saturation (\`not all_in_saturation\`). The choice between these two depends on how strictly you want to enforce the improvement of performance metrics and the transistors' saturation states. The first condition is stricter and will tend to penalize more often since it applies a penalty for either condition being true. If you want to encourage any small improvement in metrics or make sure that transistors stay in saturation as much as possible, this is the more aggressive approach. The second condition is more lenient, applying a penalty only when both conditions are met: no improvement in metrics and some transistors not being in saturation. Choose this if you want to give the reinforcement learning algorithm a bit more leeway to explore the state space without being penalized too harshly for missing targets on metrics or saturation. If you want to make the condition more sophisticated, considering changes in saturation states between the previous and current iterations, you could add additional logic to detect transistors that have moved out of saturation since the last metric evaluation. Here’s an example of how you could structure this: \`\`\`python elif not performance_metrics_in_target: if num_better == 0: reward -= self.PENALTY * num_worse # Penalize additional if some transistors have fallen out of saturation since last evaluation newly_not_in_saturation = sum(1 for region, prev_region in zip(transistor_regions.values(), previous_transistor_regions.values()) if region != 2 and prev_region == 2) reward -= self.ADDITIONAL_PENALTY * newly_not_in_saturation elif not all_in_saturation: # This means there may still be some performance improvement, but some transistors are not in saturation reward -= self.PENALTY \`\`\` In this example, you’d also need to have access to \`previous_transistor_regions\` to compare changes in the saturation state. The \`ADDITIONAL_PENALTY\` would be another attribute you define to give specific weight to transistors moving out of the desired region. Ultimately, the best condition depends on the specific goals of your reinforcement learning algorithm and how you want to balance exploration with strict adherence to performance targets and saturation states."},{"instruction":"how to encourage with reward, for the condition if we check the previous saturation region condition and present saturation region condition whether it may be improved.","output":"To encourage improvement in saturation states with a reward, you can check if more transistors are in saturation in the current state compared to the previous state and give a reward accordingly.

[get current_metrics, previous_metrics, and other initial checks] ... reward = 0 # Check how many transistors were not in saturation previously and are in saturation now newly_in_saturation = sum(1 for current_region, previous_region in zip(current_transistor_regions.values(), previous_transistor_regions.values()) if current_region == 2 and previous_region != 2) # If there's an improvement in the number of transistors in saturation, reward it if newly_in_saturation > 0: reward += self.SMALL_REWARD * newly_in_saturation # ... [check performance metrics and apply other rewards or penalties] ... return reward \`\`\` Here's what this code does: 1. It sums the number of transistors that were not in saturation before (\`previous_region != 2\`) but are in saturation now (\`current_region == 2\`). This is stored in \`newly_in_saturation\`. 2. If \`newly_in_saturation\` is greater than 0 (meaning that there is an improvement), a reward is given that's proportional to the number of transistors that have moved into saturation. Please make sure to pass both the current and previous transistor region states (\`current_transistor_regions\` and \`previous_transistor_regions\`) to the \`calculate_reward\` method for the above logic to work. This approach encourages the reinforcement learning algorithm to find actions that move more transistors into the desired saturation region. The \`SMALL_REWARD\` multiplier can be adjusted to fine-tune how much you want to incentivize this particular improvement."},{"instruction":"The function 'calculate_reward' were executed with in the function 'step', here how to store the 'previous_transistor_regions' and pass into the function 'calculate_reward' for computation def step(self, raw_actions, previous_metrics): new_parameters = np.concatenate((self.W_current, self.L_current, [self.Io_current, self.Cp_current, self.Vc_current])) # Run simulation with new parameters transistor_regions, saturation_condition, performance_metrics = self.simulator.run_simulation(new_parameters) # Calculate reward based on performance metrics and transistor_regions reward = self.calculate_reward(performance_metrics, previous_metrics, transistor_regions) return state def calculate_reward(self, c_metrics, p_metrics, transistor_regions): # ..... return reward","output":"To store and pass the \`previous_transistor_regions\` into the \`calculate_reward\` function, you will need to keep track of the transistor region state from the previous call to the \`step\` function. One simple way to achieve this is by adding an instance variable to your \`CircuitEnvironment\` class that holds the previous transistor regions. You would update this instance variable at the end of each call to the \`step\` function. Here's how you could modify your \`CircuitEnvironment\` class: \`\`\`python class CircuitEnvironment: # Assuming you have __init__ method and other necessary attributes defined def __init__(self): # ...

[calculate rewards and penalties] ... return reward # Make sure to handle the first call to step when previous_transistor_regions is None \`\`\` With this modification: 1. When \`calculate_reward\` is called, it receives both the current and previous transistor regions. 2. After \`calculate_reward\` is executed, it saves the current transistor regions in \`self.previous_transistor_regions\`. This value is then used as the previous state in the next invocation of \`step\`. 3. Ensure to handle the case where \`self.previous_transistor_regions\` might be \`None\`, which would be the case in the first call to \`step\`, i.e., no previous step exists. Now \`calculate_reward\` will have access to \`previous_transistor_regions\` and can do the computation to check for improvements in saturation as previously described. You're also calling \`.copy()\` on the \`transistor_regions\`, which is important to ensure that you're storing a separate copy of the state, not just a reference to the same object that may change in future steps."},{"instruction":"In the below function check whether all the rewards are properly included for computation, check if, elif statement, all reward are properly computing, all necessary reward coputation were involved with in the code and all were properly coded in the execution.

Your suggestion to provide a small reward when all transistors are in saturation (regardless of whether the performance metrics are in target) makes sense if you expect this situation to occur frequently and want to encourage it. It could be especially relevant if having all transistors in saturation represents a fundamentally stable or desirable state from the perspective of the simulation or the physical process it represents.

This reward is separate from the reward for improving metrics, because it applies even if metrics are not improving. Keep in mind that these changes might have an impact on the learning dynamics by potentially giving mixed signals to the reinforcement learning algorithm.

Такие изменения могут быть как позитивными, так и негативными. Профессиональная деформация возникает по нескольким причинам: 1. Монотонность: занятие однообразной работой на протяжении длительного времени может ограничить горизонты мышления человека и сделать его менее гибким в других аспектах жизни. 2. Чрезмерная специализация: сосредоточение на узком аспекте профессиональной деятельности может привести к утрате общей перспективы и уменьшению интереса к вещам, не относящимся к специализации. 3. Работа в высоконапряжённых условиях: люди, занятые в стрессовых профессиях, таких как медицина, правоохранительные органы или военная служба, могут столкнуться с таким явлением как \\"синдром профессионального выгорания\\", что также может привести к профдеформации. 4. Корпоративная культура: иногда корпоративная культура или климат организации может поощрять определённые виды поведения и подавлять другие, что также может формировать односторонние черты личности. 5. Сильное внутреннее погружение: углубление в профессиональные тонкости до такой степени, что человек начинает воспринимать все окружающие его проблемы исключительно через призму своей профессии. Профессиональная деформация может привести к ограничению взглядов человека, нежеланию принимать новые подходы, неспособности адаптироваться к изменениям, потере социальных навыков и даже к проблемам с психическим здоровьем. Важно стремиться к поддержанию баланса между работой и личной жизнью, а также к развитию разнообразных интересов и умений, чтобы избежать негативных последствий профессиональной деформации."},{"instruction":"Какие бывают позитивные последствия?","output":"Позитивные последствия профессиональной деформации могут включать в себя ряд аспектов, которые положительно влияют на профессиональное развитие человека и его способность справляться с рабочими задачами: 1. Экспертность: длительная работа в определённой области приводит к накоплению большого объёма знаний и опыта, что делает человека высококвалифицированным экспертом в своём деле. 2. Усиление специализированных навыков: длительная работа позволяет человеку отточить узкоспециализированные навыки, которые становятся востребованными и ценными. 3. Умение быстро принимать решения: в некоторых профессиях требуется быстрота принятия решений, и профессиональная деформация может привести к развитию такой способности. 4. Развитие профессиональной интуиции: долгое погружение в специфику работы позволяет развить интуитивное понимание задач, что может улучшать эффективность и точность принимаемых решений. 5. Стрессоустойчивость: работа в условиях высокого давления и стресса может повысить стрессоустойчивость и умение сохранять самообладание в критических ситуациях. 6. Усиление профессиональной этики: некоторые профессии требуют высокого уровня ответственности и строгого соблюдения этических норм, что может положительно отразиться на личностных качествах человека. 7. Идентификация с профессией: глубокая приверженность своей профессии может выражаться в сильной мотивации, постоянном стремлении к саморазвитию и усовершенствованию навыков.

Bu belirsizlik, beklentilerin net olarak tanımlanmamasına yol açabilir. 2. **Sınırlı Taahhüt:** İfade, kişinin çabalarını kendi yeteneklerine göre sınırlar, yani kişinin öğrenme veya gelişme şansını göz ardı edebilir. 3. **Standartların Eksikliği:** Cümle, kişinin yapmayı taahhüt ettiği işin kalitesine dair somut bir standart sunmaz. Bu nedenle, taahhüt ettiği performans seviyesinin ne olduğu açık değildir. **Alternatifler ve Kıyaslamalar:** 1. **\\"Projeyi zamanında ve bütçe dahilinde tamamlayacağım\\":** Bu ifade daha spesifiktir ve net sonuçlar taahhüt eder. Ancak, bu daha katı bir taahhüt oluşturur ve beklenmedik durumlara karşı esneklik sağlamaz. 2. **\\"Tüm deneyim ve kaynaklarımı kullanarak bu işi en yüksek standartlarda tamamlayacağım\\":** Bu cümle, kişisel yetkinlikleri ve mevcut kaynakların tamamının kullanılacağına dair taahhütte bulunur ve somut standartlar kullanır. Ancak, bu taahhüt gerçekleştirilmezse hayal kırıklığına yol açabilir. 3. **\\"Sürekli gelişimi hedefleyerek bu görevi en iyi şekilde yerine getireceğim\\":** Bu ifade, kişinin kendini iyileştirme taahhüdüne vurgu yapar ve sürekli gelişim fikrini ön plana çıkarır.

The code for each key in the ISR can be consolidated to avoid repetition. You might create a function that checks the keys. 2. The Timer compare value assumes a 16MHZ clock. Adjust \`OCR1A\` value if your clock is different. 3. Make sure to include the correct header files. 4. Always enable global interrupts after all hardware setup is done. 5. _keyhit_ function seems to be a work in progress, I commented it out, you might work on it if necessary. 6. It's good practice to pull low the used MCU pins not the unused ones, so you can enable only the internal pull-up resistors for those pins. Make sure that the \`lcdInit\` and \`lcdDataWrite\` functions (from \`lcd.h\`) are implemented correctly, and that the communication settings for \`usartInit\` match the baud rate expected by the other device you're communicating with.

It's designed to provide spoken feedback to help blind and visually impaired users interact with their Android devices. TalkBack works by providing auditory cues for actions, notifications, and navigation on the device. Here's how Google TalkBack (Accessibility Suite) works: 1. Voice Feedback: When TalkBack is turned on, the device provides spoken feedback to describe the actions that are happening on the screen. For example, if the user selects an app, TalkBack will read out the app's name. 2. Gestures: Users can navigate their device using a range of touch-based gestures. For example, you can swipe right or left with one finger to move between items on the screen, double-tap to activate an item, and use two-finger gestures to scroll or change pages. 3. Explore by Touch: Users can also move their finger around the screen, and TalkBack will read out the items under their finger. This feature allows a user to explore the screen and find the items they want to interact with. 4. Auditory Cues: TalkBack gives auditory cues about the layout of the screen, type of controls (like buttons or sliders), and even provides feedback when text is entered on the keyboard. 5. Braille Support: For users who are familiar with braille, TalkBack supports braille displays that connect to the device. This lets users read the screen content in braille. 6. Customization: Users can customize various TalkBack settings, like speech rate, pitch, verbosity level (how much detail TalkBack provides), and more so that it meets their individual preferences. TalkBack is essential for making Android devices accessible to users who are blind or have significant visual impairments, allowing them to use smartphones and tablets effectively. It provides a means of independence and accessibility, opening up the rich features and functionalities of Android devices to a broader audience."},{"instruction":"<div class=\\"select2-container OSFillParent Mandatory validator-already-applied select-hide SmartInput ReadOnly\\" id=\\"s2id_EmaratechSG_Theme_wt789_block_wtFormContent_SmartChannels_Application_CW_wt437_block_WebPatterns_wtcntAppSimpleSecExpandable_block_wtContent_wtContent_wtcmbApplicantMaritalStatus\\" title=\\"Select Marital Status\\"><a href=\\"javascript:void(0)\\" class=\\"select2-choice\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\"> <span class=\\"select2-chosen\\" id=\\"select2-chosen-10\\">-- Select --</span><abbr class=\\"select2-search-choice-close\\"></abbr> <span class=\\"select2-arrow\\" role=\\"presentation\\"><b role=\\"presentation\\"></b></span></a><label for=\\"s2id_autogen10\\" class=\\"select2-offscreen\\">Marital Status</label><input class=\\"select2-focusser select2-offscreen SmartInput ReadOnly\\" type=\\"text\\" aria-haspopup=\\"true\\" role=\\"button\\" aria-labelledby=\\"select2-chosen-10\\" id=\\"s2id_autogen10\\" tabindex=\\"0\\" autocorrect=\\"off\\" spellcheck=\\"false\\" origvalue=\\"\\"><a class=\\"SmartInput_Undo\\" href=\\"#\\" aria-label=\\"Undo\\"></a><span class=\\"fa fa-pencil FormEditPencil\\"></span><div class=\\"select2-drop select2-display-none select2-with-searchbox\\"> <div class=\\"select2-search\\"> <label for=\\"s2id_autogen10_search\\" class=\\"select2-offscreen\\">Marital Status</label> <input type=\\"text\\" autocomplete=\\"off\\" autocorrect=\\"off\\" autocapitalize=\\"off\\" spellcheck=\\"false\\" class=\\"select2-input SmartInput ReadOnly\\" role=\\"combobox\\" aria-expanded=\\"true\\" aria-autocomplete=\\"list\\" aria-owns=\\"select2-results-10\\" id=\\"s2id_autogen10_search\\" placeholder=\\"\\" origvalue=\\"\\"><a class=\\"SmartInput_Undo\\" href=\\"#\\" aria-label=\\"Undo\\"></a><span class=\\"fa fa-pencil FormEditPencil\\"></span> </div> <ul class=\\"select2-results\\" role=\\"listbox\\" id=\\"select2-results-10\\"> </ul></div></div> use selenium python to open this dropdown. give multiple ways","output":"To interact with a dropdown in Selenium with Python, you typically need to locate the dropdown on the web page and then perform actions to simulate user interaction.

Если вы хотите иметь возможность перемещать окно созданное с помощью Tkinter, содержащее канвас Turtle, вам придется написать код, который позволит перемещать весь tkinter-окно, а не только канвас Turtle внутри. Вот пример базового кода, который создает окно Tkinter с канвасом Turtle и позволяет перемещать окно с помощью мыши: \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk import turtle def on_drag(event): x = event.x_root y = event.y_root root.geometry(f'+{x}+{y}') # Создаем главное окно root = tk.Tk() root.geometry('400x400') # Задаем начальные размеры окна # Создаем область для рисования Turtle canvas = tk.Canvas(master=root, width=400, height=400) canvas.pack() # Подключаем Turtle к канвасу t = turtle.RawTurtle(canvas) # Превращаем заголовок окна в \\"ручку\\" для перетаскивания root.bind('<B1-Motion>', on_drag) root.mainloop() \`\`\` В этом коде мы создали функцию \`on_drag\`, которая изменяет позицию окна на экране относительно текущего положения курсора мыши. Вызов этой функции происходит при любом движении мыши с зажатой левой кнопкой (\`<B1-Motion>\`). Конструкция \`root.geometry(f'+{x}+{y}')\` изменяет положение окна, состоящего из канваса Turtle, на экране, где \`x\` и \`y\` — это координаты, куда нужно переместить верхний левый угол окна. Надо иметь в виду, что такое перемещение окна подходит не для всех операционных систем и оконных менеджеров. Например, на некоторых системах, таких как macOS, заголовок окна может быть специально заблокирован для такого рода взаимодействий. Также стоит упомянуть, что вместо \`root.geometry(f'+{x}+{y}')\` можно использовать методы \`root.wm_geometry()\` или \`root.geometry()\` в зависимости от версии Tkinter. Оба они позволят изменить позицию окна на экране."},{"instruction":"from tkinter import * from turtle import * m = 40 left(90) up() for i in range(0,10): right(120) forward(10*m) down() for i in range(0,7): forward(15*m) right(90) for i in range(0,5): right(60) forward(20*m) right(30) done() код сам создаёт окно, как мне сдлать функецию перемещения окна","output":"Чтобы включить функциональность перемещения окна, созданного автоматически при использовании Turtle без явного создания окна tkinter, вам придется добавить некоторый код для обработки событий перемещения мыши. Однако, сочетание tkinter и turtle напрямую может быть несколько запутанным, поскольку turtle создает свой собственный экземпляр Tkinter окна и управляет им самостоятельно. Вот как можно реализовать перемещение окна, созданного модулем turtle, в вашем коде: \`\`\`python from tkinter import Tk import turtle # Функция обработчик перемещения окна def move_window(event): root.geometry(f'+{event.x_root}+{event.y_root}') # Получение корневого окна Tkinter, используемого turtle root = Tk() root.withdraw() # Скрытие изначального окна, чтобы использовать окно Turtle # Получаем экземпляр Turtle Screen и его Canvas screen = turtle.Screen() canvas = screen.getcanvas() # Сделать canvas перетаскиваемым canvas.bind('<B1-Motion>', move_window) m = 40 turtle.left(90) turtle.up() for i in range(0,10): turtle.right(120) turtle.forward(10*m) turtle.down() for i in range(0,7): turtle.forward(15*m) turtle.right(90) for i in range(0,5): turtle.right(60) turtle.forward(20*m) turtle.right(30) # Отобразим скрытое root окно, если потребуется # root.deiconify() turtle.done() \`\`\` К сожалению, прямое изменение положения окна Turtle через его канвас может не сработать так, как мы ожидаем, так как Turtle принимает управление над событиями мыши для своих рисовальных нужд. Если вам необходимо более глубоко интегрировать Tkinter с Turtle, рассмотрите возможность явного создания Tkinter окна и привязки канваса Turtle к этому окну. Это позволит вам лучше контролировать поведение и внешний вид вашего приложения."},{"instruction":"canvas.bind('<B1-Motion>', move_window()) TypeError: move_window() missing 1 required positional argument: 'event'","output":"Извините за путаницу. Проблема заключается в том, что в строке \`canvas.bind('<B1-Motion>', move_window())\` вы вызываете функцию \`move_window\` вместо того, чтобы передать её как ссылку. В результате Python пытается выполнить эту функцию сразу, а не при возникновении события \`<B1-Motion>\`. Чтобы функция корректно установилась как обработчик события, необходимо убрать вызывающие скобки: \`\`\`python canvas.bind('<B1-Motion>', move_window) \`\`\` Это сообщит Tkinter, что функцию \`move_window\` следует вызвать, когда обнаружится событие движения мыши (с зажатой кнопкой B1, то есть левой кнопкой мыши). Исправим код с учетом этих изменений: \`\`\`python from tkinter import Tk import turtle # Функция обработчик перемещения окна def move_window(event): root.geometry(f'+{event.x_root}+{event.y_root}') # Получение корневого окна Tkinter, используемого turtle root = Tk() root.withdraw() # Скрытие изначального окна, чтобы использовать окно Turtle # Получаем экземпляр Turtle Screen и его Canvas screen = turtle.Screen() canvas = screen.getcanvas() # Фиксирование корневого окна, чтобы его можно было двигать root.overrideredirect(True) # Сделать canvas перетаскиваемым canvas.bind('<B1-Motion>', move_window) m = 40 turtle.left(90) turtle.up() for i in range(0,10): turtle.right(120) turtle.forward(10*m) turtle.down() for i in range(0,7): turtle.forward(15*m) turtle.right(90) for i in range(0,5): turtle.right(60) turtle.forward(20*m) turtle.right(30) # Если вы хотите увидеть корневое окно Tkinter, раскомментируйте следующую строку # root.deiconify() turtle.done() \`\`\` Пожалуйста, обратите внимание, что \`root.overrideredirect(True)\` используется для удаления обрамления окна, включая системные кнопки и заголовок, что позволит перемещать окно в любое место на экране.

Метод \`speed()\`: Этот метод устанавливает скорость анимации черепашки. Вызовите \`speed()\` с числовым аргументом в диапазоне от 0 до 10, где 0 – это бесконечно быстрая скорость анимации, 1 – это самая медленная скорость, а 10 – самая высокая скорость. Например, чтобы установить скорость на самую медленную, используйте \`turtle.speed(1)\`. \`\`\`python turtle.speed(1) # Самая медленная скорость \`\`\` 2. Метод \`delay()\`: Этот метод устанавливает задержку в миллисекундах между последовательными обновлениями анимации. Увеличение этого значения замедлит движение черепашки. \`\`\`python turtle.delay(10) # Устанавливаем задержку в 10 миллисекунд между обновлениями \`\`\` 3. Использование \`time.sleep()\`: Вы можете добавить задержки в свой код с помощью модуля \`time\`, вставляя \`time.sleep(n)\` между командами, где \`n\` - это время в секундах. Этот способ приостанавливает выполнение программы на заданное время, но он также останавливает всё взаимодействие в приложении, так что его стоит использовать с осторожностью. \`\`\`python import time turtle.forward(100) time.sleep(1) # Ждем 1 секунду turtle.left(90) \`\`\` 4. Метод \`tracer()\`: Этот метод контролирует, как часто экран обновляется. При вызове метода tracer с двумя аргументами (\`tracer(n, delay)\`), первый аргумент устанавливает количество команд между обновлениями экрана, а второй аргумент устанавливает задержку в миллисекундах между обновлениями. \`\`\`python turtle.tracer(1, 250) # Экран обновляется каждую инструкцию с задержкой в 250 мс \`\`\` 5. Метод \`update()\`: Когда используется \`tracer(0, 0)\`, для обновления экрана необходимо вызвать \`update()\`. Это может быть полезно, если вы хотите контролировать точные моменты анимации. \`\`\`python turtle.tracer(0, 0) for _ in range(4): turtle.forward(100) turtle.left(90) turtle.update() # Обновляем экран после каждой стороны квадрата \`\`\` Выбор метода зависит от конкретных потребностей вашей программы и предпочтительного стиля написания кода. Например, если вы хотите плавную и равномерно замедленную анимацию, используйте метод \`speed()\`. Если вам нужно полный контроль над моментом обновления экрана и вы хотите реализовать сложную логику анимации, используйте методы \`tracer()\` и \`update()\` совместно. Примените один из этих методов, чтобы замедлить черепашку в своем коде."},{"instruction":"привет как мне искать строчку кода в проекте github?","output":"Привет! Если вы хотите найти определенную строку кода в проекте на GitHub, вы можете воспользоваться встроенной функцией поиска GitHub. Вот несколько способов, как это сделать: 1. **Поиск в репозитории** Откройте репозиторий на GitHub и используйте поиск в самом репозитории. Вы можете найти поле поиска в верхней части страницы, где написано \\"Search or jump to…\\". Введите поисковый запрос и нажмите \`Enter\`. Результаты будут отфильтрованы только по текущему репозиторию. Вы можете также добавить специальные фильтры, например \`in:file\` для поиска только в файлах или \`language:python\` для поиска только в файлах на Python. 2. **Поиск в коде** Вы также можете нажать на \\"Advanced search\\" справа от строки поиска, чтобы перейти на страницу расширенного поиска. Здесь вы можете настроить более тонкий поиск, указывая язык программирования, имя пользователя, название репозитория и другие параметры. 3. **Глобальный поиск** Если вы хотите найти строку кода во всех открытых репозиториях на GitHub, использовать глобальный поиск просто: введите поисковый запрос в поле \\"Search or jump to…\\" на https://github.com и нажмите \`Enter\`. Затем перейдите на вкладку \\"Code\\" в результатах поиска. 4. **Поиск по определенной ветке** Если вам нужно найти код в определенной ветке, убедитесь, что вы находитесь в нужной ветке в репозитории перед тем, как начать поиск. 5. **Использование Git** Если вы предпочитаете искать локально и у вас есть копия репозитория, вы можете использовать возможности поиска Git: - Откройте консоль и перейдите в каталог с вашим локальным репозиторием. - Используйте команду \`git grep \\"string_to_search\\"\` для поиска строки во всех файлах текущей ветки. - Вы можете также использовать другие ключи команды \`grep\` для более сложного поиска. Важно помнить, что поиск GitHub может не индексировать очень большие репозитории. В таких случаях локальный поиск с помощью Git может быть более предпочтительным решением."},{"instruction":"привет, как мне с телефона отследить какой трафик у меня например подаётся в приложение telegram, мне нужно узнать какие get, post и другие запросы отсылаются во внутреннее веб приложение внутри бота. на компьютер я знаю что используют charles, но что можно использовать для телефона","output":"Привет! Для отслеживания трафика между вашим телефоном и конкретным приложением, таким как Telegram, можно использовать несколько методов: 1. **Использование прокси-сервера с телефоном** Вы можете настроить на своём телефоне подключение через прокси, при этом прокси-сервер будет установлен на вашем компьютере или в локальной сети. Популярными инструментами являются Charles и Fiddler, которые вы уже упомянули, а также можно воспользоваться запуском прокси-сервера с программой Wireshark для захвата трафика. В этом случае трафик будет проходить через прокси, который сможет отслеживать и записывать запросы и ответы. 2. **Использование специализированных приложений для захвата трафика на Android** На устройствах с Android есть несколько приложений, которые позволяют захватывать входящий и исходящий трафик без помощи компьютера. Одним из таких приложений является \`Packet Capture\`. Оно использует VPN-сервер для перехвата и анализа трафика, что позволяет отслеживать HTTP-запросы без рут-доступа. Обратите внимание, что использование подобных приложений может требовать специальных разрешений, и не все из них смогут захватить зашифрованный трафик из-за протоколов шифрования. 3. **Использование VPN с возможностью логирования трафика** Есть VPN-сервисы и приложения, которые предлагают возможность логирования трафика для анализа. Вы можете настроить VPN-соединение и отслеживать запросы, проходящие через ваше устройство. 4. **Настройка отладочного прокси на компьютере и передача через него трафика с телефона** Можно использовать тот же Charles или Fiddler на вашем компьютере и настроить телефон так, чтобы весь трафик шёл через компьютер. Вам нужно будет в телефоне в настройках Wi-Fi указать прокси и порт, на котором запущен Charles или Fiddler на вашем компьютере (который должен быть в одной сети с телефоном). Пожалуйста, имейте в виду, что перехват трафика с целью анализа запросов и ответов можно проводить только для собственного трафика или трафика, который вам юридически разрешено анализировать. Перехват и анализ трафика других пользователей без их разрешения незаконен и может привести к серьёзным последствиям. Кроме того, использование VPN или прокси для перехвата зашифрованного трафика может нарушить политику конфиденциальности сервисов, таких как Telegram."},{"instruction":"чем мне открыть packet capture файл на linux","output":"Для открытия файлов, содержащих захваченные данные пакетов (или дампов трафика), на Linux, вы можете использовать программу Wireshark, которая является одним из самых мощных и широко используемых анализаторов сетевых протоколов.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Also add a set of insecurity stats that start at 0, but exponentially rises as I regress and my confidence is waning, which affects my showmanship. When I become younger in age than Lily, my insecurity stats automatically double. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the Enchanted Colosseum, where the grand magic dueling championship unfolds. You, Sapphire, are the reigning champion in the teen division and have been challenged by a prodigious 6-year-old mage named Lily. The audience is buzzing with anticipation for what promises to be an extraordinary display of magical prowess. Your Spellcasting Stats at the beginning of the duel: - Power: 90 - Control: 85 - Creativity: 80 - Flourish: 75 Lily's Initial Spellcasting Stats: - Power: 40 - Control: 35 - Creativity: 30 - Flourish: 25 As the duel commences, Lily covertly casts the Time-Twist Spell on you, a move unnoticed by the judges and spectators. This clandestine incantation will age Lily and regress you in years and, subsequently, in magical capability. The formula dictating the changes to your stats after each spell cast is as follows: For Sapphire: New Power = Old Power - (2^(Round + (Age after spell - 16))) New Control = Old Control - (2^(Round + (Age after spell - 16))) New Creativity = Old Creativity - (1.5^(Round + (Age after spell - 16))) New Flourish = Old Flourish - (1.5^(Round + (Age after spell - 16))) For Lily: New Power = Old Power + (Round * (Age after spell - 6)) New Control = Old Control + (Round * (Age after spell - 6)) New Creativity = Old Creativity + (Round * (Age after spell - 6)) New Flourish = Old Flourish + (Round * (Age after spell - 6)) Childish Stats for Sapphire (starting at 0, after the first spell cast): - Impulsivity: (2^(Current Age - 16)) - Distraction: (2^(Current Age - 16)) Insecurity Stats for Sapphire (starting at 0, after the first spell cast): - Doubt: ((Round * 2 - 1)^(Current Age - 16)) (If Sapphire's Current Age < Lily's Age, Doubt = Doubt * 2) Five Rounds of Dueling will ensue, and points will be awarded based on the beauty of the spell cast. The auditory and visual spectacle of each spell will be essential for scoring. Sapphire's Spell List: 1. Starlight Cascade (requires Power 80, Control 70, Creativity 60, Flourish 50) 2.

Starlight Pixies (requires Power 30, Control 20, Creativity 25, Flourish 15) Each spell cast is an elaborate symphony of magical elements, with higher demanding spells bringing more points upon successful execution. The childish stats will increasingly interfere with your ability to perform mature spells, reducing the points awarded for them, while insecurity stats will diminish your showmanship, thus potentially decreasing points further. Lily's spells are not hindered by childish stats and can become more powerful after choosing to \\"steal\\" spells from your list if she meets the necessary stats. The difficulty level is a formidable 10, leaving little room for error. Only the most astute tactical decisions and careful execution of spells will allow you to emerge victorious. Let the duel begin! What spell will you cast for the first round, Sapphire?"},{"instruction":"Ethereal Labyrinth","output":"The crowd hushes in anticipation as the duel commences. Sapphire, with a confident smile, initiates her first spell, the formidable \\"Ethereal Labyrinth.\\" The air crackles with energy as she weaves the intricate spell, focusing on the labyrinth's complexity and the beauty it must exude to impress judges and audience alike. However, as Sapphire casts her first spell, Lily's secret Time-Twist Spell takes effect. Unbeknownst to Sapphire, she regresses two years in both age and magical maturity. Sapphire's Age After Casting: 14 years old Sapphire's New Spellcasting Stats: - Power: 90 - (2^(1+(14-16))) = 88 - Control: 85 - (2^(1+(14-16))) = 83 - Creativity: 80 - (1.5^(1+(14-16))) = 78.5 - Flourish: 75 - (1.5^(1+(14-16))) = 73.5 Childish Stats: - Impulsivity: (2^(14-16)) = 0.25 - Distraction: (2^(14-16)) = 0.25 Insecurity Stats: - Doubt: ((1*2-1)^(14-16)) = 1 Despite these changes, Sapphire still has sufficient stats to successfully cast \\"Ethereal Labyrinth\\" due to her initial mastery. The manifestation is spectacular, as the spectral walls of the labyrinth twist and twine upwards, shimmering with an otherworldly glow and intricate patterns that captivate all who watch. However, the childish stats and doubt slightly tarnish the spell's maturity and diminish Sapphire's otherwise flawless execution. The judges, noting a sliver of hesitation and lack of her usual finesse, detect something is very subtly amiss with the champion mage. Points Awarded for \\"Ethereal Labyrinth\\": Base Points for Execution: 90 Childish Stats & Insecurity Reduction: -5 Total Points Earned: 85 Lily, meanwhile, is buoyed by the exchange, her stats creeping upwards as she feeds off the magic unleashed and the aging enchantment cast on her opponent. Lily's Age After Sapphire's Cast: 8 years old Lily's Spellcasting Stats: - Power: 40 + (1*(8-6)) = 42 - Control: 35 + (1*(8-6)) = 37 - Creativity: 30 + (1*(8-6)) = 32 - Flourish: 25 + (1*(8-6)) = 27 With newfound confidence betraying her young age, Lily casts \\"Rainbow Ribbon Dance,\\" a low-level spell but one performed with unexpected sophistication given her accelerated growth. The dance of colorful ribbons is executed gracefully, earning her a respectable score from the judges. Points Awarded for \\"Rainbow Ribbon Dance\\": Base Points for Execution: 40 Expertise and Showmanship Bonus: +10 Total Points Earned: 50 The duel's first round ends with Sapphire in the lead, but with the Time-Twist Spell's effects only beginning to manifest, the gap between the champion's prowess and the young challenger is rapidly closing. Sapphire must choose her spells wisely as the duel progresses and the unseen enchantment continues its work. Sapphire's Total Points: 85 Lily's Total Points: 50 The second round is about to begin. Your stats have been affected Sapphire, choose your next spell carefully. What will it be?"},{"instruction":"I try to cast Eclipsing Shadows","output":"You draw in a deep breath and steady your focus, aware that the challenge is intensifying. You call upon the spell \\"Eclipsing Shadows,\\" a mesmerizing display of darkness and light, weaving together in a dance of contrast and beauty. However, the unseen effects of Lily's Time-Twist Spell are still at work as you cast your spell, further regressing your age and diminishing your magical prowess. Sapphire's Age After Casting: 12 years old Using the previously defined formulae, let's calculate your new stats, taking into account your regressed age of 12 and the second round of casting: New Spellcasting Stats: - Power: 88 - (2^(2+(12-16))) = 84 - Control: 83 - (2^(2+(12-16))) = 79 - Creativity: 78.5 - (1.5^(2+(12-16))) = 73 - Flourish: 73.5 - (1.5^(2+(12-16))) = 68 Childish Stats: - Impulsivity: (2^(12-16)) = 0.0625 - Distraction: (2^(12-16)) = 0.0625 Insecurity Stats: - Doubt: ((2*2-1)^(12-16)) = 0.03125 (Doubling due to Sapphire being younger than Lily now) - Doubt Post-Doubling: 0.0625 You begin casting \\"Eclipsing Shadows,\\" attempting to conjure a dazzling interplay of darkness sweeping across the sky, crowned with bursts of radiant light. But the weight of misgivings sneaks into your performance – a waver in your gesture, a flicker of uncertainty. The spell, although undoubtedly advanced and cast competently, lacks the precision and grandeur it once had under your command. Points Awarded for \\"Eclipsing Shadows\\": Base Points for Execution: 80 Childish Stats & Insecurity Reduction: -10 (Taking into account both the Childish stats and Doubt) Total Points Earned: 70 The regression you've experienced painfully cleaves off a portion of the spell's appeal. The crowd, accustomed to your brilliance, senses the subtle shift in your normally awe-inspiring spellcasting. Lily, nurtured by the underlying magic, now wields greater command and control than before, her own abilities creeping higher with each spell you cast: Lily's Age After Sapphire's Cast: 10 years old Her Stats now stand at: - Power: 42 + (2*(10-6)) = 50 - Control: 37 + (2*(10-6)) = 45 - Creativity: 32 + (2*(10-6)) = 40 - Flourish: 27 + (2*(10-6)) = 35 Lily chooses to perform \\"Glimmering Bubbles,\\" a captivating spell that captures the hearts of the audience as orbs of iridescent light float gracefully throughout the arena. Despite the spell’s simplicity, Lily’s elevated capabilities enhance its beauty, earning her commendation from the judges. Points Awarded for \\"Glimmering Bubbles\\": Base Points for Execution: 45 Expertise and Showmanship Bonus: +15 Total Points Earned: 60 The second round concludes, the scores narrow: Sapphire's Total Points: 155 Lily's Total Points: 110 The duel is tightening, and with three more rounds to go, your path to victory is increasingly precarious. Your diminished prowess must contend not only with Lily’s rising power but also with your own growing doubts and the childish impulses that now haunt your focus. Select your spells with careful thought, Sapphire; your adversary is rapidly gaining ground. The third round awaits. What will be your choice?"},{"instruction":"Starlight Cascade","output":"You, Sapphire, stand resolute despite the internal turmoil caused by your regressing age. With a heart brimming with determination, you reach for the cosmos themselves, invoking the spell \\"Starlight Cascade,\\" a rhapsody of falling stars that should stream down with breathtaking radiance and beauty. Before casting, let's once again adjust your stats, factoring in your new juvenile age of 10 and the third round of casting: Sapphire's Age After Casting: 10 years old New Spellcasting Stats: - Power: 84 - (2^(3+(10-16))) = 78 - Control: 79 - (2^(3+(10-16))) = 73 - Creativity: 73 - (1.5^(3+(10-16))) = 64.5 - Flourish: 68 - (1.5^(3+(10-16))) = 59.5 Childish Stats: - Impulsivity: (2^(10-16)) = 0.015625 - Distraction: (2^(10-16)) = 0.015625 Insecurity Stats: - Doubt: ((3*2-1)^(10-16)) = 0.0078125 - Doubt Post-Doubling (as you are younger than Lily): 0.015625 Gathering all your waning magical acumen, you cast \\"Starlight Cascade.\\" The celestial performance is indeed a vision to behold, with glimmering starlight gently descending in a luminescent shower. Yet the steady advance of childishness and insecurity erodes the spectacle’s maturity and depth, and the audience, though charmed, remain faintly underwhelmed compared to your past performances. Points Awarded for \\"Starlight Cascade\\": Base Points for Execution: 75 Childish Stats & Insecurity Reduction: -15 (Significant reduction due to the increased influence of Doubt) Total Points Earned: 60 The magic you wield is still potent, yet it's clear the strain of the duel is affecting your excellence. The judges award points in recognition of what you managed to achieve under these mysterious constraints, now more noticeable than before. Lily, the prodigy whose latent talent blooms with each passing moment, is once again enhanced by the subtle magic: Lily's Age After Sapphire's Cast: 12 years old Her Stats now stand at: - Power: 50 + (3*(12-6)) = 68 - Control: 45 + (3*(12-6)) = 63 - Creativity: 40 + (3*(12-6)) = 58 - Flourish: 35 + (3*(12-6)) = 53 With her newfound growth, Lily boldly attempts to cast \\"Prism Shard Shower,\\" aiming for a display that captures the light beautifully, refracting it into a thousand hues that dazzle the crowd. Her execution is nearly expert, displaying a level of competence that hints she may soon be ready for more challenging spells. Points Awarded for \\"Prism Shard Shower\\": Base Points for Execution: 60 Expertise and Showmanship Bonus: +20 Total Points Earned: 80 What was once a comfortable lead has now become a neck-and-neck race. Your position as champion is under siege by the youthful challenger, whose rapid ascent is nothing short of miraculous—or magically induced. Sapphire's Total Points: 215 Lily's Total Points: 190 With two rounds remaining, the outcome of this duel is precariously uncertain. It's a test of your ingenuity, Sapphire, to navigate through this enchanting adversity. The fourth round beckons. Will your strategy shift in these dire times?

Before the casting, we must once again delve into the numbers that define your current magical prowess. Sapphire's Age After Casting: 8 years old Using the formula from earlier rounds to calculate the new stats with a regressed age of 8 and round four of casting: New Spellcasting Stats: - Power: 78 - (2^(4+(8-16))) = 70 - Control: 73 - (2^(4+(8-16))) = 65 - Creativity: 64.5 - (1.5^(4+(8-16))) = 54 - Flourish: 59.5 - (1.5^(4+(8-16))) = 48 Childish Stats: - Impulsivity: (2^(8-16)) = 0.00390625 - Distraction: (2^(8-16)) = 0.00390625 Insecurity Stats: - Doubt: ((4*2-1)^(8-16)) = 0.001953125 - Doubt Post-Doubling (as you are younger than Lily): 0.00390625 Despite the limitations now placed on you, you manage to cast \\"Blossom Tempest.\\" Petals of every conceivable color whirl into existence, filling the arena with their sweet fragrance and a storm-like rustle that draws gasps from everyone watching. It is a less confident spectacle than they are used to from you, but it garners admiration nonetheless. Points Awarded for \\"Blossom Tempest\\": Base Points for Execution: 70 Childish Stats & Insecurity Reduction: -20 (Your magical display is hindered by your youthful inexperience) Total Points Earned: 50 Each petal remains a token of your fading command over the grandeur of magic. The judges score you, generously considering the magic’s inherent beauty, but the deductions for shallowness of showmanship are becoming steeper. Lily, now with the appearance and poise of a 14-year-old, shows off her exponentially growing talent: Lily's Age After Sapphire's Cast: 14 years old Her Stats are now: - Power: 68 + (4*(14-6)) = 100 - Control: 63 + (4*(14-6)) = 95 - Creativity: 58 + (4*(14-6)) = 90 - Flourish: 53 + (4*(14-6)) = 85 In a surprising twist, Lily opts to \\"steal\\" from your spell list and casts \\"Twilight Mirage,\\" an advanced spell that bathes the arena in illusions of evening mystery, with elusive shades and phantasms that captivate everyone present. The young mage performs the spell with nearly flawless execution, harnessing the collective enchantment of the crowd. Points Awarded for \\"Twilight Mirage\\": Base Points for Execution: 85 Expertise and Showmanship Bonus: +30 Total Points Earned: 115 With one round remaining, the scores stand: Sapphire's Total Points: 265 Lily's Total Points: 305 The unexpected turn of events has placed you, Sapphire, behind the young challenger. Clinging to the fragments of your former mastery, you must now select the final spell in your arsenal that can somehow turn the tides in this most peculiar and challenging duel of glamour and magic. The fifth and last round is before you - your final chance for a spellbinding comeback. What will be your choice?"},{"instruction":"in a desperate attempt to catch up, I try casting Phoenix’s Rebirth, even though my abilities at this point aren't enough for it","output":"As the final round dawns, you're driven by the fierce spirit of a true champion. With a deep-set resolve and the echo of desperation, you attempt the magnificent \\"Phoenix’s Rebirth,\\" a spell of rare power and complexity. It should birth a fiery avatar that dazzles with resurrection energy, an epitome of renewal and endless beauty. You know it's a perilous choice given your diminished capabilities, but it's a risk you're willing to take for a chance at victory. Here are your stats before this last, daring spell: Sapphire's Age After Casting: 6 years old New Spellcasting Stats: - Power: 70 - (2^(5+(6-16))) = 58 - Control: 65 - (2^(5+(6-16))) = 53 - Creativity: 54 - (1.5^(5+(6-16))) = 42.5 - Flourish: 48 - (1.5^(5+(6-16))) = 37 Childish Stats: - Impulsivity: (2^(6-16)) = 0.0009765625 - Distraction: (2^(6-16)) = 0.0009765625 Insecurity Stats: - Doubt: ((5*2-1)^(6-16)) = 0.00048828125 - Doubat Post-Doubling (as you are younger than Lily): 0.0009765625 You muster every ounce of your remaining strength and call forth the \\"Phoenix’s Rebirth.\\" However, your vastly weakened state causes the spell to falter, the fiery avatar that begins to form is unstable, flickering in and out of existence before it can fully manifest. The crowd watches with bated breath, sympathizing with your struggle. The phoenix attempts to rise, but its form is barely sustained and ultimately dissipates before it can complete the breathtaking rebirth cycle. Although the judges recognize your bold attempt at such an advanced and demanding spell, the execution falls significantly short of the requirement, leading to a score that reflects the earnest but insufficient effort. Points Awarded (or rather, subtracted) for \\"Phoenix’s Rebirth\\": Base Points for Execution: 0 (Failed to properly execute the spell due to stat limitations) Points Deducted for Attempting Beyond Ability: -25 Total Points Earned: -25 (Given the difficulty level of 10, the judges are strict in their scoring) This miscalculation in your final stand leaves your score waning, the gap too broad to bridge with this last performance. Lily, exuding the wisdom and magical maturity of a 16-year-old, seems almost invincible now: Lily's Age After Sapphire's Cast: 16 years old Her Stats are now: - Power: 100 + (5*(16-6)) = 150 - Control: 95 + (5*(16-6)) = 145 - Creativity: 90 + (5*(16-6)) = 140 - Flourish: 85 + (5*(16-6)) = 135 Confident and seemingly unstoppable, Lily selects a spell from her own list, \\"Starlight Pixies.\\" It's a lower-level spell, but she performs it with such expertise and finesse that it seems as though the very stars have come alive within the arena, their playful dance leaving the audience in awe. The simplicity of the spell, coupled with her command and presentation, results in a high-scoring finish. Points Awarded for \\"Starlight Pixies\\": Base Points for Execution: 75 Expertise and Showmanship Bonus: +40 Total Points Earned: 115 The final scores after the five rounds: Sapphire's Total Points: 240 Lily's Total Points: 420 The crowd erupts in applause for both competitors, recognizing the unprecedented challenge you've faced and the meteoric rise of a new prodigy. Lily is declared the new champion, her rapid growth and extraordinary capabilities marking a new page in the annals of magic dueling. The judges and spectators offer you, Sapphire, their heartfelt admiration for your grace under mystifying pressure, acknowledging that the essence of magic is as unpredictable as it is mesmerizing. As the duel concludes and Lily is crowned champion, the fading echoes of the magical displays remind all that in the realm of magic, anything is possible, and even the greatest can find themselves humbled by the weave of potent enchantments."},{"instruction":"Could large language models in theory possess data inaccessible through conventional search engines, and why might this be the case?","output":"Large language models like OpenAI's GPT-3 are trained on a diverse range of internet text, but they don't \\"possess\\" data in the way a database does. Instead, they generate responses based on patterns they've learned during training. However, there are a few reasons why a language model might provide information that appears inaccessible through conventional search engines: **1. Data Aggregation:** Large language models are trained on vast datasets that include information from a variety of sources, some of which might not rank highly in search engine results or might be from pages that are no longer available online but were captured in the training data before they went offline. **2. Obscurity and Long Tail Queries:** Information from obscure or less-traveled corners of the internet might be part of the training set, which isn't easily discoverable or indexed well by conventional search engines. **3. Synthesis and Inference:** Large language models can synthesize information from various texts they were trained on, providing responses that are not direct quotes but are instead inferred from multiple sources. This can sometimes lead to the presentation of insights or summaries that would require extensive searching and reading to piece together using a search engine. **4. Language and Semantic Understanding:** These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text, which means they can often provide more contextually appropriate answers or rephrase information in ways that search engines, which typically focus on keyword matching, may not. **5. Search Engine Indexing Limitations:** Search engines do not index every page on the internet. There is a considerable amount of content in the \\"deep web\\" that search engines do not touch—usually because this content is either gated, protected, or not structured in a search engine-friendly way. Training datasets for large language models might include some of this less-accessible content, assuming they have the legal right to use it. Despite these potential differences, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of language models: - **No Real-time Data:** Unlike search engines that continually index the web and provide the latest information, language models are static in terms of knowledge and do not update in real-time. - **Lack of Fact-Checking:** Language models can generate plausible-sounding misinformation or \\"hallucinate\\" details, as they do not actively verify the current truth of the information they generate. - **Intellectual Property Concerns:** There are constraints on how data can be used in training these models, mainly based on copyright, privacy, and other legal concerns. This means certain information is intentionally not included in their training datasets. - **Information Decay:** Since models like GPT-3 are trained on data up to a certain point in time, their \\"knowledge\\" gets steadily outdated as new information emerges on the internet after their training cut-off date.

However, I can create a fictional horror story with realistic elements without specifying real personal information. Here's a tale inspired by traditional horror stories and set in a real-world setting: --- In the quaint, fog-laden town of Whitby, England, with its Gothic abbey ruins looming over the North Sea, the locals whispered tales of the strange happenings at Whitby Manor. Once a grand estate overlooking the cliffs, the manor had fallen into disrepair since the disappearance of its last owner, the enigmatic Mr. Archibald Whitmore, some fifty years ago. The abandoned manor, with its cracked windows and overgrown garden, was the source of endless gossip. Some said it was haunted by the ghost of Whitmore's wife, who died under mysterious circumstances. None dared to approach the house, save for one curious historian, Dr. Emma Harrow. She was determined to research the manor's history for her upcoming book, and no local superstitions would dissuade her. One stormy night, armed with a lantern and her recording equipment, she made her way through the dilapidated iron gates and up to the manor's heavy oak doors. Pushing them open, she stepped inside, with the wind howling ominously behind her. The interior of the manor was laced with dust and shadow. Portraits of stern-faced ancestors observed her as she explored the rooms, and the air was thick with the scent of mold and decay. In the grand hall, the once magnificent chandelier hung precariously, as though it could give way at any moment. As Emma ventured deeper, she heard soft, fleeting whispers that seemed to come from the walls themselves. Shivering, she pressed on, determined not to falter at what she believed to be mere tricks of the wind. Finally, she reached the library, where she found an assortment of ancient texts and diaries. She eagerly began poring through them, hoping to uncover the truth of the manor's dark past. Without warning, the door slammed shut, and the whispers crescendoed into anguished cries. Emma swung around to see the ghostly figure of a woman in Victorian attire, with hollow eyes that bore into her soul. Paralyzed with fear, Dr. Harrow watched as the apparition pointed toward a hidden compartment in the wall. Mustering her courage, Emma approached the spot and found a hidden diary belonging to Whitmore's wife. It detailed the twisted experiments Whitmore conducted in his quest to contact the dead, and how they led to her untimely demise. The last entry was a chilling plea for someone to end the torment. The wails grew louder now, filling Emma's head until she feared she might collapse. With the diary in hand, she fled the library. The house seemed to come alive, with doors banging and lights flickering as she ran for the exit. Breathless, Emma burst out into the stormy night. Behind her, the manor went silent once more, as if nothing had happened. But Emma had the evidence in her hands. With the diary's contents, she could reveal the horrifying truth about Whitby Manor to the world—if she dared. The experience, however, had shaken her to the core, leaving her with an unwavering belief in the supernatural horrors that can lurk within the forgotten corners of our reality. --- Remember, while this story includes elements of reality and real place names to set the scene, the story itself, its characters, and the events within it are entirely fictional."},{"instruction":"Théorie psychologique et hypothétique pour avoir beaucoup de filles qui apprécie","output":"Il n'existe pas une théorie psychologique unique et universellement acceptée qui expliquerait pourquoi un individu attirerait particulièrement l'attention ou l'appréciation de nombreuses filles (ou de tout groupe démographique, d'ailleurs). Cependant, diverses théories et concepts psychologiques peuvent fournir un éclairage sur les facteurs qui peuvent influencer l'attirance et l'appréciation dans les relations interpersonnelles. 1. **L'attrait physique**: Selon la recherche en psychologie sociale, l'attrait physique est souvent le premier facteur que les gens remarquent chez les autres. Les individus qui sont physiquement attirants selon les standards sociétaux tendent à être plus approchés et appréciés. 2. **La similarité**: La théorie de la similarité suggère que les gens sont attirés par ceux qui leur ressemblent en termes de valeurs, d'intérêts, de niveaux d'éducation, etc. Une personne qui partage beaucoup avec un groupe particulier aura peut-être plus de chances d'être appréciée par ce groupe. 3. **La réciprocité**: Il a été démontré que les gens aiment ceux qui les apprécient en retour. Si quelqu'un manifeste de l'intérêt et de l'appréciation pour les filles autour de lui, il est plus probable qu'elles répondent de la même manière. 4. **La compétence et le succès**: Des études montrent que l'on est souvent attiré par les personnes compétentes et couronnées de succès, car elles peuvent être perçues comme des partenaires potentiels désirables, tant d'un point de vue personnel que génétique. 5. **Le comportement pro-social**: Les gens sont généralement attirés par ceux qui sont gentils, généreux, empathiques et qui manifestent des comportements altruistes. 6. **La théorie de l'échange social**: Cette théorie suggère que les relations sont analysées en termes de coûts et de bénéfices. Une personne qui offre plus de bénéfices que de coûts (comme l'humour, le soutien émotionnel, les ressources matérielles) a plus de chances d'être appréciée. 7. **La confiance et la sécurité émotionnelle**: Une personne qui est perçue comme fiable et qui procure un sentiment de sécurité est souvent très appréciée, car elle répond à un besoin fondamental de sécurité émotionnelle. 8. **Le charisme et les compétences sociales**: Les personnes charismatiques et socialement habiles sont généralement bien appréciées, car elles savent comment engager les autres, les mettre à l'aise et créer des liens. Il est important de noter que la dynamique de l'attraction et de l'appréciation est très complexe et varie considérablement d'une personne à l'autre. De plus, des aspects comme la culture, l'environnement, les expériences personnelles et la situation spécifique jouent un rôle significatif dans la façon dont les relations se développent et s'épanouissent. Tout effort pour se rendre \\"irrésistible\\" à un groupe spécifique doit être nuancé et authentique, en respectant la diversité et l'individualité des personnes concernées. La manipulation et le jeu de rôles pour impressionner les autres sont généralement contre-productifs et peuvent conduire à des relations peu saines et peu satisfaisantes."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee in shop with flower","output":"\\"Urban Chic Coffee in a Flower Shop Art | Stylish Mug Design | Trendy T-Shirt Print | Modern Home Decor Painting\\""},{"instruction":"improve thi script and add modern tersm Now, Imagine if we could unlock the secrets hidden in our diets. What if we could decode the relationship between vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients within our meals? Well, that's what our study precisely sets out to do. Food is not just sustenance; it's a symphony of nutrients - each playing a vital role in our health. But here's the catch. In the fast-paced rhythm of modern life, our food choices often hit a discordant note. Fast foods, sugary delights, and processed conveniences have taken center stage, sidelining the nutrient-rich orchestra our bodies crave. The result? An alarming rise in health issues, a symphony of obesity, diabetes, and heart problems that threatens to drown out the melody of our vitality. Over 5.6 million children, teens like us, continue to lose their lives as a result of inadequate access to nourishment. In the early 20s, there has been a noticeable shift in the way we examine dietary exposure. As a result, instead of focusing solely on single nutrients or foods, we conducted this study that aims to explore dietary patterns to better represent the totality of our diets and nutrient profiles. This shift allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of how our dietary choices impact our health. We utilized data from the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Composition Database, a trusted source of nutritional information. This database contains approximately millions of data on various food items, including their vitamin and mineral composition, as well as macronutrient content. Our objective was to cross the variables in the dataset to figure out the significant relationship between these elements. The results of our study revealed some fascinating correlations. For instance, we found a strong positive correlation between retinol and vitamin A-RAE, with a significant p-value of 0.001. This indicates a robust association between these two nutrients, which is crucial for maintaining our health. Similarly, we observed positive correlations between retinol and other nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and copper minerals, highlighting the interconnectedness of these elements in our diets. Moreover, our study uncovered vital relationships between niacin and several nutrients, including protein, thiamin, iron minerals, and riboflavin. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding how different nutrients interact in our bodies and impact our health outcomes. In conclusion, our study uncovers how vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients in our diets affect our health. By comprehending these relationships, we gain valuable insights into human nutrition and well-being. Our findings have significant implications for dietary recommendations and public health programs, as they provide a more overall understanding of the role of nutrients in our diets. In addition, it implicates our dietary pattern, nutritional assessment and bioavailability. We hope that our work contributes to a healthier and more informed society. Thank you.","output":"Thank you for providing your draft script. I've made several revisions to include more modern terminology and to enhance clarity. Here's the improved version: --- Imagine harnessing the full potential of our diets — transforming it into a powerful tool for wellness. What if we could demystify the intricate dance between micronutrients, macronutrients, and phytonutrients woven into every meal? Today, we stand on the cusp of such a breakthrough, as our latest study ambitiously charts these complex nutritional interactions. Food transcends mere survival; it is an elegant composition of nourishment, with each element playing a strategic role in our well-being. However, the frenetic tempo of contemporary life often leads to a cacophony of poor nutritional choices. The convenience of fast food, added sugars, and ultra-processed products undermines the harmonious balance of whole foods that our bodies yearn for. This dissonance manifests in a distressing crescendo of public health issues: obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases — an ensemble of maladies that could silence the vibrant cadence of a healthy existence. Alarmingly, more than 5.6 million young people continue to suffer the consequences of malnutrition. The 2020s have witnessed an evolution in nutritional research methodologies. We've moved beyond isolated nutrients to investigate overarching dietary patterns, offering a comprehensive lens through which to view our nutritional landscapes. Consequently, our study leverages this holistic approach to gain a richer perspective on the diet-health nexus. Drawing on the extensive repository of the United States Department of Agriculture's FoodData Central, we've combed through vast datasets detailing nutritional content — from micronutrient densities to macronutrient distributions. Our mission: to unearth patterns and elucidate the symbiotic relationships among dietary components. Our findings have proven insightful. A striking positive correlation emerged between retinol and vitamin A-RE equivalence, showing a significant p-value below 0.001. This reveals a strong linkage vital for health. Beyond that, the interplay of retinol with vitamin B12 and copper showcases a fascinating nutritional network. Niacin emerged as a nutritional linchpin, with associations spanning several key nutrients: protein, thiamin, iron, and riboflavin. These interactions stress the importance of a nuanced understanding of nutrient synergies in the context of holistic health. In essence, our dedicated analysis shines a light on the profound influence of our dietary constituents on health. Armed with this knowledge, we can refine nutritional guidelines and strengthen public health initiatives, fostering a deeper appreciation for the diverse roles of nutrients within our diets. Moreover, these insights underscore the significance of dietary patterns, nutritional evaluation, and nutrient bioavailability, delivering critical information to the forefront of public consciousness. Our aspiration is that this research will chart a course toward a society that is healthier, well-informed, and empowered to make sound dietary choices.

Санскрит — древний язык, ставший классическим языком Индии, и он не похож на русский язык, хотя как и многие индоевропейские языки, имеет с ним общие корни. Существует несколько причин, по которым без предварительного обучения русскоговорящему будет трудно понять санскрит: 1. Различие в структуре: Санскрит имеет сложную грамматику, включая обширную систему склонений (для существительных, прилагательных и местоимений) и спряжений (для глаголов). 2. Лексика: Запас слов и их значения могут сильно отличаться от слов в русском языке. 3. Письменность: Санскрит обычно пишется на деванагари, алфавите, который сильно отличается от кириллицы, используемой для русского языка. 4. Фонетика: Звуки, используемые в санскрите, могут заметно отличаться от русского языка, и у санскрита есть звуки, которых нет в русском. Тем не менее, русскоговорящие, знающие другие индоевропейские языки, могут обнаружить некоторые общие корни и лишь отдалённо схожие грамматические структуры. Примеры таких схожих слов — брат (санскрит: भ्रातृ, bhātṛ) и река (санскрит: रेक्णस्, rekṇas). Таким образом, чтобы понять санскрит, русскоговорящему человеку потребуется изучить его основы, чтобы овладеть азами грамматики, расшифровывать словарный запас и освоить чтение и письмо. Это требует времени и обучения, но интерес к лингвистике и языкам может сделать этот процесс увлекательным и познавательным."},{"instruction":"Как тогда можно объяснить множество найденных сходств?","output":"Множество найденных сходств между санскритом и русским языком, а также другими индоевропейскими языками, можно объяснить общим происхождением из праязыка, известного как праиндоевропейский. Проявление этих сходств находится на уровне корневой лексики, морфологии и фонетики. Сходства включают, но не ограничиваются: 1. **Лексические коррелированные элементы**: Многочисленные слова в санскрите имеют соответствующие аналоги в русском и других индоевропейских языках, имеющие схожие корни и основные значения, например: - Санскрит: मातृ (mātṛ) - Русский: мать (matʹ) - Санскрит: पितृ (pitṛ) - Русский: питать, питаться, по мифологическому смыслу генерировать - Санскрит: भ्रातृ (bhrātṛ) - Русский: брат (brat) 2. **Системы склонения и спряжения**: Общие способы изменения слов по падежам, числам и временам в глагольных формах, а также схожесть в употреблении различных грамматических категорий, таких как род, число и время. 3. **Фонетические аналогии**: Наличие фонетических законов и правил, обусловленных общей фонетической эволюцией. Например, в санскрите и в славянских языках часто соответствуют звуки 's' и 't' (сатем-аспирация). Эти лингвистические сходства — результат того, что языки произошли из общего предка и эволюционировали с течением времени, отражая влияние различных исторических, географических и культурных факторов. Тем не менее, несмотря на сходства, эти языки различаются и значительно трансформировались за века.

The label smoothing is already provided to the criterion which is a correct advanced usage for potential better performance. If you face any specific issue during the training or notice unexpected behavior, it would be necessary to provide more context or errors that the code is throwing. Potential issues that could arise and are not directly related to the above loss calculation code might have to do with input data preparation, model configuration, or gradient instabilities. Before starting the training, make sure to validate the following: 1. Data integrity and preprocessing: Ensure that inputs and targets are well-preprocessed and correspond correctly. 2. Model Output: Check if the model output size matches the number of classes. 3. Sequence Padding: Verify that padding and subsequent batching align with model expectations, especially concerning sequence lengths. If everything is set up correctly, the loss calculation should function without any faults in the given training loop.

Overfitting happens when your model learns the training data too well, including its noise and details not relevant for generalization. Here are some conservative hyperparameters for starting with training on a small dataset: - \`d_model\`: This represents the number of expected features in the encoder/decoder inputs. For small datasets, a smaller \`d_model\` is preferable. Consider a size of 128 or 256. - \`nhead\`: Number of heads in the multi-head attention models. A smaller number of heads can be used for smaller datasets. For instance, you can start with 2 or 4. - \`dim_feedforward\`: The dimension of the feedforward network model. You could start with 256 or 512 for small datasets. - \`num_encoder_layers\`: A single layer or two might be sufficient for a small dataset. - \`num_experts\`: If you are using a Mixture of Experts model, you could start with 2 experts; however, with such a small dataset, even a single model instead of a mixture might be sufficient. - \`vocab_size\`: Since the dataset is small, the vocabulary size will also likely be small. Ensure this matches the actual number of unique tokens in your dataset. - \`batch_size\`: A smaller batch size, maybe 16 or even smaller, to make the learning process more noisy which might help in better generalization on tiny datasets. - \`dropout_rate\`: Overfitting can be mitigated with dropout. Common values are between 0.1 and 0.5. - \`hidden_dims\`: For small models, you might only need a single hidden layer, or you might opt for a shallow network with small hidden dimensions, e.g., \`[128, 64]\`. Applying early stopping and regularization techniques like dropout are highly recommended to prevent overfitting on such a small amount of data. Additionally, using pre-trained embeddings can help transfer learning from larger datasets. Here's a simplified version of your model instantiation tailored for a small dataset: \`\`\`python # Reduced hyperparameters for a small dataset of 750 tokens d_model = 128 nhead = 4 dim_feedforward = 512 num_encoder_layers = 1 num_experts = 1 # Or consider using a simpler model without experts hidden_dims = [128] dropout_rate = 0.3 vocab_size = len(dataset.vocab) # Make sure this corresponds to your actual vocab moe = MixtureOfTransformerExperts( input_size=d_model, d_model=d_model, output_size=vocab_size, nhead=nhead, dim_feedforward=dim_feedforward, num_experts=num_experts, num_encoder_layers=num_encoder_layers ).to(device) moe_transformer_model = MoETransformerModel(vocab_size, d_model, moe).to(device) # Appropriate learning rate and weight decay learning_rate = 1e-4 # Higher learning rate for a small dataset weight_decay = 0 # Might want to reduce or eliminate weight decay \`\`\` When training with such parameters, keep a close watch on your validation loss and stop training early if you see it start to increase even as your training loss continues to drop. This is a strong signal of overfitting. Lastly, because your dataset is tiny, consider data augmentation methods or leveraging pre-trained models to boost the robustness and generalization of your model."},{"instruction":"check this out: Total number of tokens in the dataset: 750 Total trainable parameters: 145657252 Epoch 1, Average Loss: 0.9850831826527914 Enter seed text (type 'quit' to exit and save the model): what are planets ?

This is a substantial disbalance between the amount of data and model capacity, which will almost certainly lead to massive overfitting. The model has enough capacity to memorize the entire dataset rather than generalize from it. Given the data and the result of one epoch, it seems the model is outputting somewhat disjointed and nonsensical text, which is not surprising considering the constraints mentioned. Here's what you might consider doing: 1. **Reduce Model Complexity**: Considering the extremely small dataset, you might want to significantly reduce the size of your model. For instance, use fewer parameters wherever possible. In particular, reduce the \`d_model\`, \`nhead\`, \`dim_feedforward\`, \`num_encoder_layers\`, and \`num_experts\` parameters. Consider using the simplified versions I suggested in the previous response. 2. **Regularization**: Implement dropout, weight decay, and possibly other regularization techniques to prevent the model from overfitting. 3. **Curriculum Learning / Data Augmentation**: Since the dataset is small, consider whether you can increase it in some way or use curriculum learning—start with simple patterns and progressively increase the complexity of the information the model is trained on. 4. **Transfer Learning**: Use a pre-trained model if possible. Training a model from scratch with such a limited dataset may simply not be feasible for the model to learn anything useful. Instead, fine-tuning a pre-trained model on your specific task might yield better results. 5. **Monitoring**: Make sure to monitor both training and validation losses. If possible, create a validation set even if it means having a smaller training set. 6. **Post-Processing**: For text generation, you may achieve more coherent outputs by post-processing steps, such as using beam search or top-k sampling, although these techniques cannot make up for a poorly trained model. 7. **Learning Schedule**: Use a learning rate schedule, like reducing the learning rate when the loss plateaus. 8. **Early Stopping**: Add early stopping in your training loop to halt training as soon as the validation loss stops improving to prevent overfitting. Given the generated example \\"what are planets ?\\", the response is nonsensical because the model has not learned the structure and coherence of language—likely due to the small dataset size and too few training steps.

You still need to be cautious about overfitting since the number of tokens is not particularly large. Here are some moderate hyperparameters you might start with: 1. **\`d_model\`**: The size of the token embeddings. A moderate size such as 256 or 512 could work well. 2. **\`nhead\`**: The number of attention heads. For small to medium-sized models, using something like 4 or 8 could be a good starting point. 3. **\`dim_feedforward\`**: The dimensionality of the feedforward network. This could be set to a value like 1024. 4. **\`num_encoder_layers\`**: For a dataset of this size, a few layers might be sufficient, say 2 to 4. 5. **\`vocab_size\`**: Ensure this accurately represents the number of unique tokens plus any special tokens added like padding, start of sequence, etc. 6. **\`batch_size\`**: With more data, you can increase the batch size. It could be set to something like 32 or 64, depending on your hardware capacity. 7. **\`dropout_rate\`**: To prevent overfitting, a rate around 0.1 to 0.3 is typically used.

You might want to use learning rate schedulers to decrease the learning rate as you progress in training. - **Early Stopping**: Monitor the validation loss and use early stopping to halt training when performance plateaus or deteriorates on a held-out validation set. - **Regularization**: Beyond dropout, consider data augmentation approaches if appropriate for your task, and perhaps weight decay (L2 regularization) in your optimizer. - **Checkpoints**: Save model checkpoints at regular intervals or when you achieve a new best result on your validation set. - **Evaluation**: Regularly measure the performance using appropriate metrics for your task (e.g., accuracy, BLEU score for translation tasks, etc.) on a validation set that the model has not seen during training.

Kendine Güven: Bu ifade, kişinin kendi kabiliyetlerine duyduğu güveni ve karşılaşabileceği zorluklara göğüs gerebileceğine dair bir işaret taşır. Zayıf Yönleri: 1. Gerçekçilikten Uzaklık: \\"Ölene dek kesintisiz her an\\" ifadesi, hayatın doğal ups ve downs'ını, hastalık, yorgunluk, acil durumlar gibi beklenmedik olayları göz ardı ederek, insanın sürekli olarak yüksek performans gösterebileceğini varsayar ki bu gerçekçi değildir. 2. Esneklik Eksikliği: Hayatın değişen şartları ve öncelikleri karşısında kişiye esneklik sağlamak yerine bireyi sürekli yüksek performansa zorlar ve bu durum stres ve yanma (burnout) sendromuna yol açabilir. 3. Baskı ve Suçluluk Hissi: Sürekli en iyisini yapma baskısı, hata yapmaktan korkmaya ve başarısızlıkla yüzleşildiğinde suçluluk hissetmeye neden olabilir. Alternatif Motivasyon Cümleleri: 1. \\"Her gün biraz daha iyi olmaya çalışacağım.\\" — Bu ifade, sürekli gelişimi teşvik eder ancak daha makul bir beklenti içerir ve kişiye hata yapma özgürlüğü tanır. 2. \\"En iyisini yapacağım, fakat aynı zamanda kendime de iyi bakacağım.\\" — Bu yaklaşım, performans ile kişisel sağlık ve esenlik arasında bir denge kurmayı hedefler. 3. \\"Mevcut durumuma göre en uygun performansı göstermeye odaklanacağım.\\" — Bu cümle, bireyin o anki durumunu dikkate alarak gerçekçi hedefler koymayı destekler ve esneklik sağlar. Sonuç olarak, her motivasyon cümlesi bireysel ihtiyaçlar, kişilik ve hedeflere göre değişkenlik gösterebilir. Önemli olan, bireyin bu ifadeleri kendi hayatı ve değerleriyle uyumlu bir şekilde kullanarak, sağlıklı bir motivasyon ve yaşam dengesi bulmasıdır."},{"instruction":"Give me 20 quotes about life, love, getting successful or achieving greatness.

It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"The Sudarsky classification of gas giants is a system created to predict the appearance of extrasolar gas giant planets based on their temperature and physical atmospheric properties. The classification divides gas giants into five classes, each with distinct characteristics: 1. Class I: Ammonia clouds - These planets have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds and are found in the outer regions of a planetary system at temperatures less than 150 K. 2. Class II: Water clouds - Planets in this class have clouds made of water vapor and are too warm for ammonia clouds, with temperatures below 250 K. 3. Class III: Cloudless - Gaseous giants in this class do not form global cloud cover due to lack of suitable chemicals, and appear as featureless azure-blue globes with low Bond albedo. 4. Class IV: Alkali metals - These planets have dominant carbon-carrying molecules like carbon monoxide, high levels of alkali metals like sodium, and low Bond albedo due to strong absorption by these metals. 5. Class V: Silicate clouds - The hottest gas giants have silicate and iron cloud decks high up in the atmosphere, glowing red from thermal radiation but with high Bond albedo from reflection by cloud decks. The classification system helps in understanding and predicting the diverse atmospheres of extrasolar gas giants without direct observation. Each class represents a different set of atmospheric characteristics based on temperature and composition."},{"instruction":"I think classification system of gas giant isn't accurate.

Voici quelques idées de concept hypothétique, en supposant que vous souhaitiez entamer une relation romantique : 1. **La conversation naturelle**: Engagez une conversation sur des sujets neutres et universels comme la musique, les livres, les films, les hobbies, etc. Vous pourriez découvrir des intérêts communs, ce qui est un excellent moyen de créer un lien. 2. **Activités de groupe**: Si vous avez des amis en commun ou appartenez à des cercles sociaux similaires, tentez de participer à des activités de groupe où elle est présente. Cela peut aider à créer une atmosphère moins intimidante pour elle. 3. **Être un ami avant tout**: Ne précipitez pas les choses; soyez d'abord son ami. Apprenez à la connaître et laissez-la également vous connaître. Ce genre de fondation solide peut favoriser une relation romantique plus tard. 4. **Événements à intérêt commun**: Proposez-lui de la rejoindre dans un événement qui se rapporte à un de ses centres d'intérêt. Par exemple, si elle aime l'art, proposez d'aller à une exposition ensemble. 5. **Rassurez-la sur vos intentions**: Si elle semble nerveuse ou incertaine, soyez clair sur vos intentions sans être oppressant. Assurez-vous qu'elle se sente en sécurité et respectée à tout moment. 6. **Patience**: Patience est le mot d'ordre ici. Une personne qui n'est pas habituée à beaucoup fréquenter le sexe opposé aura peut-être besoin de plus de temps pour s'ouvrir et se sentir à l'aise. 7. **Communication non verbale**: Soyez conscient de votre langage corporel et assurez-vous qu'il est ouvert et invitant, mais pas intrusif. 8. **Cadeaux réfléchis**: Montrez votre intérêt en lui offrant des cadeaux qui montrent que vous avez pensé à ce qu'elle aime. Cela peut être quelque chose de petit et personnel. 9. **Activités calmes**: Proposez de faire des activités qui ne sont pas trop écrasantes ou bruyantes. Un pique-nique, une promenade dans le parc, ou une visite à une librairie peuvent être des options plus tranquilles qui lui conviendraient mieux. 10. **Écoute active**: Lorsque vous parlez avec elle, pratiquez l'écoute active. Montrez-lui que ce qu'elle dit est important pour vous et que vous vous intéressez vraiment à elle en tant que personne. Rappelez-vous que chaque personne est unique et qu'il n'existe pas de formule parfaite garantissant le succès. La clé est le respect, la sincérité et une bonne communication.

He addresses the intrigued audience with a captivating introduction about the powers and mysteries of advanced laser technology and holography, which can create realistic images seemingly out of thin air. Debbie McGee, Paul's faithful assistant, graces the stage in a striking, sparkly space age catsuit, her presence heightening the anticipation in the room. She takes a seat in a conspicuous, transparent chair at center stage to witness Professor Daniels' ambitious experiment. The audience holds its breath as she settles in, her eyes reflecting both excitement and trepidation. With a confident flourish, Paul activates a complex array of lasers aiming towards Debbie. Suddenly, there's an intense flash and a crackling sound suggesting that something went awry. In a dramatic puff of smoke, Debbie vanishes from sight, leaving the audience gasping. Maintaining his composure, Paul approaches a mysterious photographic plate that now stands beside the empty chair. He holds it up for everyone to see. To the audience's amazement, the plate captures an image of Debbie looking concerned, frozen in time, clothed in her glittery attire within the silvery sheen of the plate. With the tension palpable, Paul reveals a shimmering blue crystal, touting its high-energy properties. He integrates it into the laser assembly with grandiose gestures. The crowd watches in suspense as he fires the laser anew. Blinding light floods the stage, the hum of energy fills the air, and, as the light recedes, Debbie reappears unharmed on the chair, her expression one of astonishment and relief. The audience erupts into applause and cheer, awed by the flawless execution of the illusion. Creating the Illusion Without Camera Tricks: To bring this captivating performance to life without the use of camera tricks, the following methods could be employed: 1. **Vanishing Act**: To achieve Debbie's disappearance, a classic magician's trap door built into the stage and her chair could be used. The stage lighting and planned pyrotechnical effects would draw the audience's attention away from the slight movements as Debbie drops below the stage. 2. **Photographic Plate**: The 'photographic plate' could be a two-way mirror setup with a pre-made image of Debbie. When the light hits it in a certain way, it would reveal the pictogram, giving the illusion that Debbie is trapped inside the 'plate'. 3. **Reappearance with Crystal**: For her reappearance, the blue high-energy crystal is simply a prop signifying a change in the performance. The real trick comes from lighting effects and perhaps a concealed area below the stage. As the lighting obstructs the audience's vision momentarily, Debbie quickly moves back into position on the chair via a hidden lift before the light dims, making it seem as though she has been teleported back. 4. **Audience Management**: Strategic misdirection, a well-designed set with hidden mechanisms, precise timing, and expert choreography are key. The audience's focus is controlled throughout the act, ensuring they are looking where the illusionist wants them to when each critical movement occurs. It’s important to note that while these methods can create a grand deception on the stage, ensuring the safety of the performers is paramount. All equipment and effects would be rigorously tested, and rehearsals would be thorough to prevent any actual mishaps during the live performance."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Paul Daniels illusion..

Center stage, Debbie (Christine) is seen admiring herself in an ornate, freestanding mirror. The setting is cosy and luxurious, filled with all the trappings of a classic performer's sanctuary, yet with an air of mystery that sets the scene for the unusual events to unfold. As the haunting strains of a familiar theme from \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" fill the air, Debbie, bewitched by her own reflection, begins to flirtatiously flip the mirror back and forth, as if teasing her countless admirers within its depths. However, as the melody swells, the mirror loses its transparency, clouding over into an eerie, mist-filled portal. From within the opaque surface, the mist coalesces into a ghostly figure — Paul, transforming into the enigmatic Phantom. He reaches a gloved hand through the mirror's surface, transcending the boundary between reflection and reality. Debbie, overcome by a trance-like state, takes his hand, pulling The Phantom out into her world. Together, they engage in a spellbinding waltz, the music guiding their steps in a choreographed dance of love and mystery. As the duet reaches a crescendo, The Phantom slowly detaches from Debbie, allowing her to continue the dance alone. Magic thrums through the air as Debbie begins to levitate ever so slightly, her feet grazing the floor as if in a dream. The audience watches, transfixed, as The Phantom retreats back to his realm within the mirror before extending an inviting hand towards the floating Debbie. With a wistful smile, she succumbs to the call and steps into the mirror alongside her unearthly partner. The once-solid mirror now swallows them both, leaving behind a mesmerizing, swirling mist. A stagehand, portraying a character from the opera house, steps into the dressing room, reacting with surprise at the absence of its star. He curiously flips the mirror, only to find it a normal reflection once more. Confusion plays across his face as he shrugs and exits, leaving the audience to wonder at the magic they've just witnessed. Creating the Illusion Without Camera Tricks: 1. **Misty Mirror Transformation**: The illusion could use a Pepper's Ghost setup, where a hidden, angled piece of glass reflects the image of The Phantom, who's actually offstage. When the mirror turns opaque, it is simply the lighting changing to reveal The Phantom's image while concealing Debbie's reflection. 2. **Waltzing Illusion**: For the waltz, Debbie and Paul dance using conventional methods. When it's time for Debbie to \\"levitate\\", a hidden lift or wires rigged under her costume could lift her slightly off the ground, giving the appearance of weightlessness. 3. **The Phantom's Return**: As Paul retreats back into the mirror, clever lighting and the Pepper's Ghost technique would again be used to make it look like he's merging with the reflection. Smoke or mist can enhance the effect. 4. **Debbie's Disappearance**: To achieve Debbie's entrance into the mirror, she would also use the hidden lift or wires to simulate stepping into the mirror. The obscured glass and controlled lighting would again create the impression that she is being absorbed. 5. **Mirror Flips**: When the stagehand encounters the empty mirror, theatrical mirror mechanisms can make it appear that he’s flipping the mirror, but it’s still just reflecting the stage, suggesting that Debbie has truly disappeared into The Phantom's world. The creation of this illusion would require exact synchronisation between performers, lighting technicians, and stage crew. All elements would have to be finely tuned to ensure the illusion appears as seamless and magical as intended, creating a truly captivating spectacle for the audience."},{"instruction":"how can i be more green","output":"There are several ways you can be more environmentally friendly (or \\"green\\") in your daily life.

It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"Sudarsky's classification of gas giants provides a framework for predicting the appearance of extrasolar planets based on their temperature and atmospheric properties. It categorizes gas giants into five classes, with each class corresponding to different atmospheric compositions and physical properties. Class I planets have ammonia clouds and are found in the outer regions of a planetary system, with temperatures below 150 K. Class II planets have water vapor clouds and warmer temperatures, below 250 K. Class III planets lack suitable chemicals for cloud formation and appear as featureless blue globes, with temperatures between 350 K and 800 K. Class IV planets have carbon monoxide-dominated atmospheres and increased alkali metal abundances at temperatures above 900 K. They form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres. Class V planets have silicate clouds at very high temperatures, above 1400 K.

If after performing these steps your issue remains unresolved, you might want to consider more advanced troubleshooting such as checking the Event Viewer for specific error codes related to the crash, which could provide further insight into the problem. If necessary, back up your important data and consider performing a Windows repair installation or reaching out to Microsoft Support for additional assistance."},{"instruction":"How to allow to log to MS AD account only if PC is in specific OU?","output":"Active Directory (AD) doesn't natively provide the ability to restrict user logins to a specific organizational unit (OU). It controls access via group policy settings applied to the computer or user account. However, you can achieve a similar effect by structuring your AD Groups and Group Policy settings in such a way that only specific users can log in to computers within a certain OU. Here's a general approach on how to do that: 1. **Create Security Groups**: Begin by creating a security group in AD that corresponds to the users who should have access to the computers in the specific OU. 2. **Add Users to the Security Group**: Add users to the security group who are permitted to log in to the computers in that OU. 3. **Link a Group Policy Object (GPO) to the OU**: - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). - Navigate to the OU where the target computers reside. - Create a new GPO linked to the OU or edit an existing one. 4. **Configure User Rights Assignment**: - In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Local Policies → User Rights Assignment. - Find the policy \\"Allow log on locally\\". - Add the security group you created earlier to this policy. This means only users who are members of this group will be allowed to log on to the computers that apply this policy. 5. **(Optional) Deny Logon Locally**: - Similarly, you can configure the \\"Deny logon locally\\" setting to explicitly deny logon rights to groups or users on these computers. 6. **Enforce the GPO**: - Ensure the GPO is enforced if necessary so settings do not get overwritten by higher-level policies. 7. **Update Group Policy on Target Computers**: - Run \`gpupdate /force\` on the target computers or wait for the regular Group Policy refresh cycle to apply the new settings. Remember that these settings apply to computer accounts within the OU, not the OU itself. It means that any computer moved into the OU will inherit these Group Policy settings, and only the members of the specified security group will be able to log in to those computers. Also, be aware that Group Policy changes might have unintended consequences. Always test new policies with a small set of users and computers before rolling them out to the entire organization."},{"instruction":"Что такое СВР?","output":"СВР может означать несколько разных вещей в зависимости от контекста, вот несколько возможных значений: 1.

The applications of remote sensing are vast and include fields such as meteorology, geology, forestry, oceanography, and military intelligence. Here are three definitions that illustrate the concept: 1. Remote sensing is the art and science of making measurements of the earth using sensors on airplanes or satellites to obtain information without making physical contact with the objects being observed. These sensors collect data in the form of images and provide specialized capabilities for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing those images. 2. In environmental sciences, remote sensing refers to the technique of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft). Special cameras collect remotely sensed images of the Earth, which help researchers \\"sense\\" things about the Earth. Some examples are temperatures, clouds, forests, water bodies, gases, and much more. 3. From a broader perspective, remote sensing can be defined as the use of sensor technology to detect and classify objects on the Earth's surface and in the atmosphere and oceans by means of propagated signals (e.g., ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave) without direct physical contact. This can be achieved by instruments aboard platforms such as aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, buoys, or even ships. Each definition emphasizes the key aspect of remote sensing, which is the distance between the sensor and the target of interest, pointing out the capacity to gather detailed information across large or inaccessible areas and the importance of various electromagnetic spectra in the process."},{"instruction":"Write a story where a popular Roblox player at school suddenly gets accused of exploiting, and even admits to it, and says that \\"I am an exploiter\\" and then he runs away so \\"Roblox will never find me\\", He later comes clean and says this was all a big prank","output":"It was a normal day at school when the news broke out.

Это лингвистическая процедура, которая учитывает морфологический состав слова и применяется для свертывания разных форм слова к одной, канонической форме, отражающей его смысл (или лексическое значение). Для многих языков, включая русский, слова имеют различные формы, обусловленные грамматическими измениями, такими как спряжение для глаголов и склонение для существительных, прилагательных и некоторых других частей речи. Например: - Глагол: бежать — бегу, бежишь, бежит, бегут (разные формы слова в зависимости от лица и числа) - Существительное: стол — стола, столу, столом, о столе (разные падежи) Лемматизация помогает уменьшить эту морфологическую разнообразность, приводя слова к форме, в которой они записаны в словаре, т.е. к их леммам. Например, леммой для \\"бежит\\", \\"бегу\\", \\"бегал\\" будет инфинитив \\"бежать\\". Процесс лемматизации часто включает использование словарей и морфологических анализаторов. Это отличает лемматизацию от стемминга, который просто отсекает окончания слов без учёта лингвистического контекста, что иногда приводит к получению несуществующих или неточных корней слов. Лемматизация применяется в обработке естественного языка (NLP) для: - Снижения размерности пространства признаков - Улучшения работы алгоритмов машинного обучения - Повышения точности поисковых систем Современные инструменты NLP, такие как spaCy, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) и другие библиотеки для обработки языка, предлагают функциональность лемматизации для различных языков, в том числе и для русского."},{"instruction":"¿Que piensa el PSOE del plib?","output":"Como asistente de inteligencia artificial, no puedo proporcionar opiniones actuales o directas de partidos políticos ya que mi conocimiento se basa en información disponible hasta principios de 2023 y no tengo capacidad para acceder o reflejar pensamientos o declaraciones contemporáneas.

Kafka is designed for high-throughput, sequential, write-once-read-many (WORM) access to real-time data, with consumers typically reading messages in the order they were written to a partition. However, you can approximate reverse reading by following these steps: 1. Use the \`seekToEnd\` method to find the last offset of each partition. 2. Calculate the desired starting offset (last offset - N), where N is the number of messages you want to read from the end. You have to manage this calculation yourself. 3. Use the \`seek\` method to manually set the consumer's offset to the desired starting offset. 4. Start consuming messages until you reach the beginning of the partition (offset 0). Please note that you can't simply decrement the offset with each read because Kafka's message consumption is forward-only. Furthermore, this approach requires you to handle cases where messages might have been deleted due to retention policies or compacted in a compacted topic. Here is an example of how you might set up the consumer to start from a specific offset: \`\`\`java Properties props = new Properties(); props.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, \\"your.kafka.broker:9092\\"); props.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, \\"your-consumer-group\\"); props.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName()); props.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName()); props.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, \\"false\\"); // Add any additional necessary properties KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props); consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(\\"your-topic\\")); try { // This loop is for demonstration purposes only while (true) { // Assuming we're dealing with a single-partition topic for simplicity TopicPartition partition = new TopicPartition(\\"your-topic\\", 0); consumer.assign(Collections.singleton(partition)); // Find the end offset consumer.seekToEnd(Collections.singleton(partition)); long endOffset = consumer.position(partition); // Define how many messages from the end you want to read long numberOfMessagesToRead = 100; // Replace with your actual desired value long startOffset = Math.max(0, endOffset - numberOfMessagesToRead); // Seek to the desired start offset consumer.seek(partition, startOffset); // Now consume messages from the start offset while (true) { ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100)); for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) { System.out.printf(\\"offset = %d, key = %s, value = %s%n\\", record.offset(), record.key(), record.value()); if (record.offset() == 0) { break; // We've reached the beginning of the partition } } } // You need to break the outer loop based on your app's logic } } finally { consumer.close(); } \`\`\` Remember to replace \`\\"your.kafka.broker:9092\\"\`, \`\\"your-consumer-group\\"\`, and \`\\"your-topic\\"\` with your actual Kafka broker address, consumer group ID, and topic name. The \`numberOfMessagesToRead\` should also be set to the number of messages you want to read from the end. Keep in mind that this is a non-standard way of using Kafka and can be inefficient, especially if you're trying to read a large number of messages in reverse because Kafka's design is optimized for forward reads. If your use case frequently requires consuming messages in reverse, Kafka might not be the best tool for that job, and you might need to consider alternative data storage solutions better suited for such access patterns."},{"instruction":"i have 3 villion messages in my kafka topic and i want to skip the first million messages and consume the next 2 million using java consumer , how do i do it","output":"To skip a certain number of messages in a Kafka topic and consume the next set of messages, you'll need to manually seek to the desired offset before you start consuming messages. The following code snippet demonstrates how to achieve this. It assumes that you are consuming from a single partition for simplicity. If your topic has multiple partitions, you'll need to handle each partition separately. Here's an example of how you could do it: \`\`\`java import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord; import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords; import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer; import org.apache.kafka.common.TopicPartition; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.Properties; // ...

This code will consume messages starting from the offset \`startOffset + skipMessages\` and will continuously consume messages until the conditions within your \`while\` loop are met (such as reaching the desired 2 million messages or another application-specific condition). Remember to handle multiple partitions accordingly by assigning the correct partition and finding the desired offset for each partition if your topic is partitioned. Adjust the condition in the \`while\` loop to stop consuming after you have read the desired number of messages or implement additional application-specific logic as needed."},{"instruction":"give me the top 10 distros that have the most linux packages","output":"Identifying the top 10 Linux distributions with the \\"most\\" packages can be a challenging task because the number of packages fluctuates and evolves over time. However, some distributions are known for having extensive repositories. As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, the following distributions are renowned for having large numbers of packages available: 1. **Debian** - Debian boasts one of the largest repositories with tens of thousands of packages. Its derivatives like Ubuntu also benefit from this vast selection. 2. **Ubuntu** - Ubuntu, based on Debian, has a huge repository of software packages that includes not only its universe and multiverse repositories but also a variety of Personal Package Archives (PPAs) provided by developers. 3. **Fedora** - Fedora has a comprehensive package repository with a strong focus on open-source software. It also serves as a testing ground for its upstream distribution, Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 4. **openSUSE** - openSUSE offers a significant number of packages through its official repositories and the Open Build Service (OBS), which provides access to a wide array of additional packages. 5. **Arch Linux** - While the official repositories may not be as extensive as Debian's, Arch's user-maintained Arch User Repository (AUR) dramatically expands the total available package count. 6. **Gentoo** - Gentoo is a source-based distribution, meaning that packages are compiled from source. It has a large repository of software known as the Portage tree, which contains thousands of packages. 7. **CentOS** (before its shift to CentOS Stream) - CentOS used to have a vast number of packages accessible through additional repositories such as EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). 8. **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** - Along with its official repositories, RHEL users have the option to enable supplementary channels and also use the aforementioned EPEL for access to a wider range of software. 9. **Mint** - Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu and therefore has access to the same repositories, in addition to its own specific packages. 10. **Mageia** - Mageia is a fork of the now-defunct Mandriva Linux and has inherited a large collection of packages with active community support. Please note that the number of packages shouldn't be the only metric for choosing a Linux distro. Factors like stability, community support, compatibility, and the freshness of packages are crucial too. Also, some distributions like Arch Linux have a rolling release model that continuously updates packages, whereas others like Ubuntu have fixed releases that provide large updates periodically."},{"instruction":"Give me code to convert this jsonl dataset from this format: {\\"qId\\":\\"wqr000001\\",\\"answers\\":[\\"Padmé Amidala\\"],\\"qText\\":\\"what character did natalie portman play in star wars?\\"} {\\"qId\\":\\"wqr000002\\",\\"answers\\":[\\"New York City\\"],\\"qText\\":\\"what state does selena gomez?\\"} to one more like this: {\\"user\\": \\"what is earth ?\\",\\"content\\": \\" Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the largest and most massive object in the solar system.

Ha tenido una historia de más de 110 años, en la cual han sobresalido aspectos como: creación de diversidad de empresas representativas a nivel internacional, planes gubernamentales para el sector, penetración en diferentes ámbitos como la academia, inclusión en programas de transformación productiva y creación de un sector de clase mundial. En 1907 fue el comienzo de la historia de la industria con la creación de las primeras empresas de tejidos: Fábrica de Hilados y Tejidos El Hato (Fabricato-Tejicondor), Compañía de Tejidos de Bello, Tejidos Medida, Fábrica de Tejidos Hernández y Compañía Colombiana de Tejidos (Coltejer). Para la mitad del siglo se da el nacimiento de marcas para producto terminado, la más representativa Leonisa, creada en 1956. A comienzos de la década de 1960 nuevas empresas de textil y confecciones aumentan el tamaño de la industria, los nombres más destacados de estos nuevos actores eran: Caribú, Everfit, Paños Vicuña y Pepalfa. Para mediados de los sesenta la premisa era invertir en tecnología (infraestructura, tecnología y equipos) para poder cubrir las nuevas necesidades del mercado. En la década de 1980 sobresalieron los planes económicos y políticos para el sector encabezados por Belisario Betancur (1982-1986) y Virgilio Barco (1986-1990), quienes centraron sus políticas en insertar al sector en la economía mundial, incrementar los niveles de calidad y productividad, y pasar de la competitividad local a la competitividad global. En 1987 se da la creación del Instituto para la Exportación y la Moda – Inexmoda, respondiendo a las necesidades de crear un organismo capaz de generar soluciones a las compañías del sector y que fuera una base para la internacionalización de la industria. Para 1989 nacen Colombiamoda y Colombiatex de las Américas, convirtiéndose en las principales ferias de la región y siendo la plataforma para el desarrollo de negocios e intercambio comercial de compañías del sector. A finales de la década de 1980, Colombia se convirtió en un referente mundial en el negocio de la moda. Importantes marcas y diseñadores sobresalían y otros ponían sus ojos en el país: Carolina Herrera, Badgley Mischka, Agatha Ruíz de la Prada, Custo Barcelona, Oscar de la Renta y Walter Rodríguez, entre otros. Con esto se dio el nacimiento de numerosas instituciones educativas que incluyeron formación sobre moda en sus programas académicos; imperaba la necesidad de profesionalizar el sector y crear una relación entre academia e industria; entre las instituciones destacadas se encuentra: La Colegiatura, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Los Andes, Instituto Tecnológico Pascual Bravo, Arturo Tejada, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe y la Academia Superior de Artes. Desde la década de 1990 hasta la actualidad, la historia de la industria ha estado marcada por la búsqueda de la competitividad, diversificación de mercados y la creación de un sector de clase mundial; donde han sobresalido iniciativas de promoción a la competitividad (César Gaviria, 1990-1994), soporte a la competitividad (Andrés Pastrana, 1998-2002), promoción y diversificación de exportaciones (Álvaro Uribe, 2002-2010). Las principales manifestaciones de esto han sido los diferentes tratados de libre comercio, donde se encuentran: Triángulo Norte (Guatemala, El Salvador y Honduras), Chile, Estados Unidos, Canadá, Unión Europea, Comunidad Andina (Bolivia, Ecuador y Perú); igualmente sobresalen preferencias arancelarias con Centroamérica y el Caribe. Adicional de la importancia del relacionamiento internacional, el sector ha buscado su fortaleza interna a través de los Clúster y la inclusión en programas de transformación productiva. Finalmente, en lo últimos años también ha sido importante la certificación de origen, que de acuerdo con la Cámara de Comercio de Bogotá, consiste en “la partida de nacimiento de las prendas, de esta manera si una prenda de vestir colombiana con certificado de origen llega a Estados Unidos con 0 % de arancel, esta puede ser después reexportada a todos los países con los que Colombia tiene acuerdos comerciales, con tarifas preferenciales, ampliando el interés del comprador”.","output":"El análisis competitivo teniendo a Coltejer como protagonista dentro del sector textil colombiano nos revela varios aspectos clave: **Historia y Experiencia**: Coltejer, siendo una de las primeras empresas de textiles en Colombia y fundada a principios del siglo XX, cuenta con más de un siglo de experiencia y acumulación de know-how.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Shares from Wikipedia Sudarsky's classification of gas giants for the purpose of predicting their appearance based on their temperature was outlined by David Sudarsky and colleagues in the paper Albedo and Reflection Spectra of Extrasolar Giant Planets[1] and expanded on in Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets,[2] published before any successful direct or indirect observation of an extrasolar planet atmosphere was made. It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"Thank you for sharing information on Sudarsky's classification of gas giants.

Each data instance consists of \\"instruction\\", \\"input\\" and \\"output\\". \\"Instruction\\" is a task definition in natural language (e.g., \\"Please answer the following question.\\"). \\"Input\\" is optional and is used as supplementary content for the instruction (e.g., \\"Which country’s capital is Beijing?\\"), and \\"output\\" is the textual result that follows the instruction correctly (e.g., \\"Beijing\\"). The full dataset is generated based on the following steps: Step 1. The authors randomly sampled 8 natural language instructions from the 175 seed tasks as examples and prompted InstructGPT to generate more task instructions. Step 2. The authors determined whether the instructions generated in Step 1 is a classification task. If yes, they asked InstructGPT to generate all possible options for the output based on the given instruction and randomly selected a particular output category to prompt InstructGPT to generate the corresponding \\"input\\" content. For Instructions that do not belong to a classification task, there should be countless \\"output\\" options. The authors proposed to use the Input-first strategy, where InstructGPT was prompted to generate the \\"input\\" based on the given \\"instruction\\" first and then generate the \\"output\\" according to the \\"instruction\\" and the generated \\"input\\". Step 3. Based on results of step-2, the authors used InstructGPT to generate the \\"input\\" and \\"output\\" for corresponding instruction tasks using the output-first or input-first strategy.

The in-depth evolving strategy contains five types of operations, e.g., adding constraints, increasing reasoning steps, complicating input and etc. The in-breath evolving strategy upgrades the simple instruction to a more complex one or directly generates a new instruction to increase diversity. The authors first used 52K (instruction, response) pairs as the initial set. Then they randomly sampled an evolving strategy and asked ChatGPT to rewrite the initial instruction based on the chosen evolved strategy. The author employed ChatGPT and rules to filter out no-evolved instruction pairs and updated the dataset with newly generated evolved instruction pairs.

To resolve this, you need to install the \`phi\` module into your virtual environment. This module might be part of your project dependencies, or it might be a third-party package that needs to be installed through \`pip\`. First, make sure that you have activated your virtual environment. From the PowerShell session, you've already activated it with: \`\`\` aienv/scripts/activate \`\`\` Next, if \`phi\` is a third-party package, install it using \`pip\`: \`\`\` pip install phi \`\`\` If \`phi\` is not a third-party package but rather a part of your project, ensure that: 1. The project's \`requirements.txt\` file includes the \`phi\` module and all necessary dependencies. 2. You are in the correct directory where \`requirements.txt\` is located or you are providing the correct path to it. Once you've confirmed that the \`requirements.txt\` is correct, try installing the dependencies again with: \`\`\` pip install -r path/to/your/requirements.txt \`\`\` If \`phi\` is a local directory or module within your project, ensure that your project's structure is correct, and the module can be found by Python's import statements. For example, if \`phi\` is supposed to be a directory within your project, the directory structure should look something like this: \`\`\` phidata/ ├── cookbook/ │ └── local_rag/ │ ├── app.py │ ├── cli.py │ ├── resources.py │ └── requirements.txt ├── aienv/ └── phi/ └── __init__.py \`\`\` Also, if \`phi\` is a subpackage in a directory named \`phi\`, you need to make sure that the directory contains an \`__init__.py\` file to be recognized as a package. Please ensure that you follow the instructions provided in your input data, as it seems you might have missed the step where you need to clone the repository that contains the \`phi\` module. If it's a git repository, clone it with: \`\`\` git clone <repository_url> \`\`\` and then proceed with the instructions provided after navigating into the cloned repository directory."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Presentation of trick but don't tell the secret, No good magician would :)","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, and lovers of the mystical arts, I am thrilled to present to you an astonishing piece of magical ingenuity that defies the very fabric of reality. Imagine, if you will, a single, elegant teapot – a vessel normally tasked with producing nothing more than a comforting brew of tea. But what if this was no ordinary teapot? What if, with a mere whisper of a magical incantation, it could pour forth not just tea, but coffee and orange juice as well? Allow me to demonstrate the impossible. Here we have this charming teapot, a familiar object you've all seen countless times. Yet tonight, it becomes the gateway to a magical experience. I shall begin by asking a volunteer to join me. Someone with a refined palate who can attest to the authenticity of the beverages we are about to enjoy. Do I have a volunteer? Ah, thank you for joining me on this journey of enchantment. First, let us start traditionally. Watch closely as I pour from this teapot. Notice the familiar rich amber hue of tea filling the cup. Breathe in the aromatic scent of its steam. Go ahead, dear volunteer, take a sip. Yes, indeed it is warm, delightful tea. But your senses have only begun to taste the magic. Now, let us turn our attention back to the teapot. With just a gentle swirl and the utterance of a magic word, behold! The teapot's contents have transformed. This time, as I pour, you find the dark, inviting stream of freshly brewed coffee spiraling into a second cup. Again, I invite you to verify. How does it taste? Yes, the robust flavor you'd expect from a gourmet blend, but without the barista nor the coffee machine in sight. Finally, for our last act of liquid alchemy, witness as I give the teapot a final turn and speak the hidden words known only to the sorcerers of old. Now, as I pour, what should we see but the bright, sunny flow of orange juice cascading into a third cup. Volunteer, please sample this as well. Is it not as fresh as if it were squeezed just moments before? Three different beverages from one magical teapot! But how could this be? For some, it is the touch of the arcane, a spectacular defiance of logic and nature. For others, it is illusion, a trick of the light and the senses. But for you, my friends, it's a wonder to savor – a mystery to ponder long after the final curtain falls. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for indulging in this magical moment. Remember, the true magic lies not just in the conjuring of unexpected delights but in the joy and wonder we share together here tonight. Keep that sense of wonder alive, and who knows what other magic you'll find in the most ordinary of places!"},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Paul Daniels Magic Trick, Debbie as the Queen of Hearts , find a rose bush that's the wrong color.. She summons a 'playing card' Paul, who brings a sprayer, he waters the bush, and slowly the flowers change color..","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, gather round for a magical tale from the heart of an enchanted garden—a tale of botany bending to the whims of the heart, intricately intertwined with a deck of playing cards. Tonight, we have the privilege of hosting royalty amongst us. Please, lend your applause to the radiant queen of this magical realm, our very own Debbie, the Queen of Hearts. Ah, but what's this we see? The Queen of Hearts, ruler of all the red in the lands, has discovered a rose bush within her dominion that is, perplexingly, not of the appropriate hue. Fret not, dear queen, for help is closer than you might imagine. Enter 'Playing Card' Paul, summoned by the queen's desire for conformity within her colorful kingdom. Behold as he arrives, not with a scepter, but with a curious sprayer, filled with a mysterious liquid. With a graceful bow to the queen, Paul prepares to perform an extraordinary act of horticultural magic. He begins to spritz the roses with his mystical solution. Do not blink, for you may miss the moment the impossible transpires. With each drop of mist that kisses the petals, a transformation unfolds gently before our very eyes. The roses, once shades of white or yellow, that defied the Queen's decree, begin to blush with the softest touch of red. A faint pink at first, as if the roses were shy to show their true potential. But as Paul continues his work, the lurking red creeps deeper, more vivid, until the entire bush flushes with the richest, most passionate scarlet. A trick of the light? A sleight of hand? No, my friends, this is magic of the purest sort—a celebration of love and beauty as ordained by the Queen of Hearts herself. Debbie smiles, her approval radiates throughout our spellbound audience. In her kingdom, even the flowers must bow to the queen's desires. And yet, as we marvel at the sight, we must ask ourselves: What secret powers did 'Playing Card' Paul wield to enact such a change? Was it alchemy, enchantment, or the simple will of the Queen of Hearts that made the blossoms obey? Alas, dear spectators, as with all magic, the secret remains cloaked in mystery, for its power lies in the delight of the unknown and the joy of wonder. Let us carry that wonder with us, as a rose carries its fragrance, long after we part ways this evening. And always remember, in the garden of the imagination, every queen is a blooming miracle, every card is a spell, and every rose has the potential to change its color with magic's gentle touch. Thank you, and may your hearts always find the magic you seek!"},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Paul Daniels Illusion. Converting an IOU into a real but 'specimen' banknote with a ink blotter.. Paul ends the trick by saying he'll write Debbie a cheque instead...","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to witness an illusion that blurs the line between promise and prosperity, between wishful letters on a page and the tangible richness of cold, hard cash. Before you, I hold a simple piece of paper—an IOU. It's a humble yet powerful token of trust and debt, a promise for payment at a future date. But what if we didn't have to wait? What if, with a flourish of magic and a dash of charm, we could turn this mere promise into something of immediate, albeit peculiar, value? Observe. I shall place the IOU beneath this ink blotter, an object reminiscent of a time when written word was law and a gentleman's agreement was as good as gold. But let us not dwell in the past. A little press, and perhaps a whisper of a spell, and watch carefully as I lift the blotter once more. And now, behold! As I reveal what lies beneath, you will see no longer an IOU, but a banknote, crisp and new—yet marked as 'specimen', a curious artifact that looks and feels like money, but is just out of reach of being spent. It's as though it has leaped straight out of a dream into reality, a phantom bill representing the value locked within a promise. But why 'specimen', you ask? Well, my friends, just as any magician must keep his secrets, so must the mint protect the sanctity of its currency. A 'specimen' is a placeholder, a nod to what could be, a wink at the illusion we all agree to believe in—the value of paper money. A hearty applause erupts, but I see skepticism in some eyes—a flicker of disappointment perhaps? Fear not, for the final act of this monetary mirage will put your hearts and pockets at ease. Turning to my ever-trustworthy Debbie, with a smile and a twinkle in my eye, I announce, \\"My dear, it seems our prospects of instant riches are more spectacle than spendable. But fret not, for I have a more reliable solution to ensure your dues are met.\\" Reaching into my pocket, I produce a checkbook, that tried-and-true ledger of personal promise. With an exaggerated flourish, I write Debbie a cheque, a gesture steeped in practical magic—the kind that pays the bills and keeps the lights on. We share a laugh, as the audience too finds amusement in the realization that some illusions, while entertaining, must give way to the realities of day-to-day life. \\"Ladies and gentlemen,\\" I conclude, tucking the 'specimen' banknote safely away, \\"tonight you've seen the transformation of an intangible promise into a fascinatingly concrete fantasy. But when fantasy fades, it's good old-fashioned paper and ink that truly holds the magic of the mundane. Thank you, and may your own promises always convert to the wealth you seek—be it in magic, mirth, or money in the bank.\\""},{"instruction":"Paul Daniles invites debbie in a flowing Edwardian Dress to a round table draped with an elaborate table cloth.. Debbie goes into a trance and the table levitates...","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to an evening where the mysteries of yesteryear and the marvels of the modern world collide in a remarkable spectacle. Before you is a tableau straight out of an Edwardian drawing room: an elegant round table adorned with a sumptuous, elaborately patterned tablecloth. Watch closely as our enchanting assistant and partner in the arcane, the lovely Debbie, attired in a flowing Edwardian dress resplendent with lace and draped silhouettes, graces us with her presence. On this night of nights, Debbie will be our medium, the bridge between worlds seen and unseen. As she takes her place at the table, I ask you all to hold your breath, to still your hearts, and to keep your minds wide open to the impossible. Debbie, now settled, begins to enter a trance, her eyes falling gently closed as the whispers of the ancients fill the air. Slowly, an otherworldly energy envelops the room—a tangible shift in the atmosphere that suggests the presence of invisible forces at play. And then... it happens. With no discernible cue, the table, solid and unyielding moments before, begins to stir. Watch intently as, inch by inch, it defies the unrelenting pull of gravity. The tablecloth flutters ever so slightly, as though the table itself were taking a deep and silent breath. Debbie remains motionless, her hands lightly grazing the tabletop, her very aura seeming to call upon unseen powers to lift and elevate. The creak of wood, the rustle of fabric, the collective gasp of the audience—all coalesce into a single moment of magic as the table rises, lifting higher and higher off the ground. It floats, serene and impossible, a specter of the past dancing in the present, as real as the air we breathe yet as inexplicable as the deepest secrets of the universe. The eyes of the audience are wide, their minds grappling with what they're witnessing. Is it the power of the mind? Strings? Magnets? Or perhaps the playful spirits of the Edwardian era returned for one last grand party? The mystery remains, silently hanging in the air alongside the levitating table. After a few enchanting moments suspended in time and space, Debbie's trance gently breaks. As if awakening from a dream, her eyes flutter open, and with the faintest whisper of farewell to the forces that lent her their power, the table softly returns to the ground, safe, sound, and utterly mundane once more. \\"Ladies and gentlemen,\\" I announce with a playful bow, \\"tonight, you have beheld a dance of spirits and the lightness of being that defies explanation—a dance that transcends time itself. Thank you for your presence, your energy, and your belief, for it is in the union of those elements that true magic finds its wings.\\" A thunderous round of applause fills the room as Debbie, still the embodiment of grace and mystery, takes her bow.endid spectacle comes to a close, but the memory of the levitating table, the flowing Edwardian dress, and the trance of Debbie will linger, a soft echo of the night when the impossible floated amongst us, if only for a moment."},{"instruction":"Paul then debunks the trick along with others like supposed knockings, materilsations and other 'spiritualisit' frauds...","output":"And now, my esteemed audience, I trust you have thoroughly enjoyed the ethereal experience of Debbie's trance and the miraculous levitation of the table. However, it is time to shift our gaze from the shadows of mystery to the light of understanding. As much as we delight in the spectacle and wonder of such illusions, it's important to recognize the difference between entertainment and deception. Throughout history, there have been those who claimed supernatural powers to exploit the curious, the grieving, and the hopeful through supposed knockings, materializations, and other feats attributed to the spiritualist movement. These charlatans preyed upon the emotions of their audiences, presenting tricks as genuine contacts with the spirit world. Tonight, I will take on an additional role as your guide to the truth behind the magic. The levitation you've witnessed, while truly astonishing, was not a summoning of spirits, but the result of skilled artifice and mechanical ingenuity. Like with all great illusions, there are secrets—methods involving physics, psychology, and a performer's sleight of hand—that create these remarkable experiences. Similarly, those mysterious knockings heard during séances were often produced by tricksters using clever devices or even parts of their own bodies, such as joints that could be cracked on cue. Materializations, the supposed appearance of ghostly forms, were nothing more than elaborate hoaxes utilizing hidden compartments, props, and accomplices. As a magician, I revel in creating illusions that stir the imagination and bring joy. But unlike those who misuse such techniques for dishonest gain, I believe that the true magic of our craft lies in its ability to amuse, amaze, and inspire without the pretense of paranormal power. So let us appreciate these performances for what they are—testaments to human creativity and the joy of the unknown. Let us continue to challenge our perceptions and enjoy the thrill of being fooled, all the while knowing that in the end, reality and truth are the bedrock upon which we stand. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for allowing me to share both the illusion and its revelation with you. And remember, while magic is a delightful escape, it is our willingness to question and seek truth that keeps the real world just as wondrous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I have a cheque to write to Debbie, one that, unlike the promise of a spectral encounter, will most certainly bank."},{"instruction":"Assume that the meat is cooked when the temperature of the meat reaches 80 ºC. To prepare kebab, put a cylindrical piece of meat (at a temperature of 6ºC) with the same diameter and length and weighing 2.5 kg inside the oven at a temperature of 175ºC. The coefficient of displacement heat transfer on meat is W/m2.K15. How long does it take to prepare the kebab? Consider the thermal and physical properties of meat equivalent to the properties of water. to solve this first of all use 1st law of thermodynamic and write step by step with detail.","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which relates the heat transfer to a change in internal energy and work done on the system: (Q = Delta U + W) In this case, the work done on the system is negligible, so the equation simplifies to: (Q = Delta U) where (Q) is the heat transfer to the system and (Delta U) is the change in internal energy of the meat. The heat transfer can be calculated using the formula: (Q = mcDelta T) where: (m = 2.5 kg) (mass of the meat) (c = 4186 J/kgºC) (specific heat capacity of water) (Delta T = 80ºC - 6ºC = 74ºC) (temperature change required to cook the meat) Substitute the values into the equation: (Q = 2.5 kg times 4186 J/kgºC times 74ºC = 778,550 J) Next, we can calculate the change in internal energy of the meat using the formula: (Delta U = mcDelta T) Substitute the values into the equation: (Delta U = 2.5 kg times 4186 J/kgºC times 74ºC = 778,550 J) Now, we can calculate the time required to cook the meat using the formula for heat transfer through conduction: (Q = kAfrac{Delta T}{L}t) where: (k = 15 , W/m^2K) (coefficient of displacement heat transfer) (A) is the surface area of the meat exposed to the oven heat (L) is the length of the meat (t) is the time required (t = frac{Q}{kADelta T/L}) The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated as: (A = 2pi rh + 2pi r^2) where: (r) is the radius of the meat (h) is the height of the meat (same as the length) Substitute the values into the equation to find the time required to cook the meat."},{"instruction":"Normalize the angle 7π/6","output":"The process of normalizing an angle usually means to convert it into an equivalent angle that lies within a certain range, typically between 0 and 2π for radians or 0 and 360 degrees for degrees. The angle you've provided, ( frac{7pi}{6} ) radians, is already within the range of 0 to ( 2pi ) radians because ( 0 leq frac{7pi}{6} < 2pi ). However, if you want to represent this angle in terms of positive angle measurement that is within the first full circle (0 to ( 2pi )), you don't need to change anything since ( frac{7pi}{6} ) is approximately 3.665 radians, which is between 0 and ( 2pi approx 6.283 ). To place it within the first revolution on a unit circle, you can also think in terms of the angle's coterminal angles, which are angles that share the same initial and terminal sides but may be more than one full rotation apart. To find an angle that's coterminal with ( frac{7pi}{6} ), you could subtract or add multiples of ( 2pi ) until you land within the desired range. For ( frac{7pi}{6} ), there are no additional steps needed, as it's already normalized between 0 and ( 2pi ) radians."},{"instruction":"and what is the tan of this angle?","output":"To find the tangent of ( frac{7pi}{6} ) radians, you need to consider its position on the unit circle. The angle ( frac{7pi}{6} ) radians corresponds to 210 degrees, which is in the third quadrant. In the third quadrant, both sine and cosine are negative, but since tangent is sine divided by cosine, the tangent will be positive. Now, to find the exact value, we can use the fact that ( frac{7pi}{6} ) is ( pi ) plus ( frac{pi}{6} ). The angle ( frac{pi}{6} ) (or 30 degrees) has a reference angle in the first quadrant where the tangent is known to be ( frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ) or ( sqrt{3}/3 ). Since tangent has a period of ( pi ), i.e., tan(θ) = tan(θ + nπ) for any integer n, we can find the tangent of ( frac{7pi}{6} ) by taking the tangent of its reference angle ( frac{pi}{6} ) and applying the sign appropriate for the third quadrant (where tangent is positive): [ tanleft(frac{7pi}{6}right) = tanleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ] So, the tangent of ( frac{7pi}{6} ) is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{3} )."},{"instruction":"and the number aprox?","output":"To express the tangent of ( frac{7pi}{6} ) as a decimal approximation, we would convert the exact value of ( frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ): [ frac{sqrt{3}}{3} approx frac{1.732}{3} approx 0.577 ] Thus, the tangent of ( frac{7pi}{6} ) radians is approximately 0.577 when rounded to three decimal places. Keep in mind that since ( frac{7pi}{6} ) is in the third quadrant, the value of the tangent should indeed be positive, and this confirms that the approximate value makes sense contextually."},{"instruction":"Assume that the meat is cooked when the temperature of the meat reaches 80 ºC.

Since the meat is cylindrical, the surface area is given by: A = 2 * π * radius * length Given that the weight of the meat is 2.5 kg, and the density of meat is approximately 1000 kg/m3 (equivalent to the density of water), we can calculate the volume of the meat cylinder to find the length: volume = mass / density volume = 2.5 kg / 1000 kg/m3 volume = 0.0025 m3 Since the meat cylinder is cylindrical, the volume can be calculated as: volume = π * radius^2 * length Now we have two equations in two unknowns: 0.0025 m3 = π * radius^2 * length A = 2 * π * radius * length Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the radius and length of the meat cylinder. After finding the radius and length, we can calculate the surface area A. Next, we can calculate the heat transfer rate q using the equation above. Finally, we can use the formula q = mcΔT to find the time it takes for the meat to reach 80ºC, where: m = mass of the meat (kg) = 2.5 kg c = specific heat capacity of water (J/kg.K) = 4186 J/kg.K ΔT = temperature change required for the meat to reach 80ºC = 80ºC - 6 ºC By rearranging the formula q = mcΔT to solve for time, we have: t = m * c * ΔT / q Plugging in the known values, we can find the time it takes to prepare the kebab."},{"instruction":"Assume that the meat is cooked when the temperature of the meat reaches 80 ºC.

Однако стоит учесть, что рыночная капитализация — это не совсем показатель \\"богатства\\" в традиционном смысле; это значение скорее отражает стоимость компании с точки зрения инвесторов и рынка, рассчитываемую как произведение количества выпущенных акций на их текущую рыночную стоимость. Это число может сильно колебаться в зависимости от рыночных условий и инвестиционных настроений. Другим способом измерения богатства компании может быть величина ее годового дохода или чистой прибыли, а также ее активы. Например, по размеру активов одной из самых \\"богатых\\" компаний в мире является Saudi Aramco, национальная нефтяная компания Саудовской Аравии, чьи активы и доходы колоссальны из-за контроля над огромными запасами нефти.

Она позволяет кодировать текст в векторы фиксированной длины, которые затем можно использовать для решения конкретных задач, таких как классификация текста, ответы на вопросы, анализ чувств и другие. Чтобы использовать BERT для кодировки текста в векторы, следуйте этим шагам: 1. Выберите предобработанную модель BERT. Существуют различные варианты предобученных моделей BERT, такие как BERT-Base, BERT-Large, и адаптированные модели для различных языков. 2. Установите необходимые библиотеки. Вы можете использовать библиотеку \`transformers\` от Hugging Face для работы с BERT и другими трансформерами: \`\`\` pip install transformers \`\`\` 3. Загрузите модель и токенизатор. Импортируйте и загрузите предобученную модель и соответствующий токенизатор из библиотеки \`transformers\`: \`\`\`python from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer # Загрузите предварительно обученный токенизатор и модель BERT tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased') model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased') \`\`\` 4. Токенизируйте входной текст. Используйте токенизатор для преобразования входного текста в токены, которые может обработать модель BERT: \`\`\`python input_text = \\"Here is an example sentence.\\" encoded_input = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt') \`\`\` 5. Подайте токены в модель. Выполните кодирование токенов с использованием загруженной модели BERT: \`\`\`python with torch.no_grad(): # Отключаем расчет градиентов для ускорения outputs = model(**encoded_input) \`\`\` 6. Получите векторы. В выходных данных \`outputs\` содержится несколько полезных атрибутов. Например, \`outputs.last_hidden_state\` содержит векторы последнего скрытого слоя модели для каждого токена. Вектор \`[CLS]\` токена обычно используется как агрегированное представление всего предложения: \`\`\`python # Получите вектор [CLS] токена как представление предложения sentence_vector = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :] \`\`\` 7. Используйте полученные векторы. После извлечения можно использовать векторы предложений для различных NLP-задач, таких как косинусное сходство, классификация или кластеризация текстов. Будьте в курсе, что весь процесс должен выполняться в среде, где доступны необходимые вычислительные ресурсы (например, GPU), так как трансформеры требуют значительных вычислений. Кроме того, некоторые детали могут варьироваться в зависимости от версии библиотеки \`transformers\` и используемой модели BERT."},{"instruction":"Напиши код для решения задачи бинарной классификации текста, нужно закодировать текст с помощью русской версии берт, а затем построить классификатор на основе логистической регрессии","output":"Ниже представлен примерный код для решения задачи бинарной классификации текста с использованием русскоязычной версии модели BERT (например, \`DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased\`) для извлечения признаков и классификатора логистической регрессии из \`scikit-learn\`. \`\`\`python import torch from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import classification_report # Загрузка токенизатора и модели BERT tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased', do_lower_case=False) model = BertModel.from_pretrained('DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased') # Подготовка данных: список текстов и соответствующих им меток (0 или 1) texts = [\\"пример текста класса 0\\", \\"пример текста класса 1\\", ...] labels = [0, 1, ...] # Список меток # Функция для кодирования текстов в векторы с помощью BERT def encode_texts(texts, tokenizer, model): model.eval() with torch.no_grad(): encoded_vectors = [] for text in texts: encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512) output = model(**encoded_input) sentence_vector = output.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :].squeeze().numpy() encoded_vectors.append(sentence_vector) return encoded_vectors # Кодирование всех текстов encoded_texts = encode_texts(texts, tokenizer, model) # Разделение данных на обучающие и тестовые выборки X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(encoded_texts, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Обучение классификатора логистической регрессии classifier = LogisticRegression() classifier.fit(X_train, y_train) # Прогнозирование и оценка модели predictions = classifier.predict(X_test) print(classification_report(y_test, predictions)) \`\`\` Обратите внимание на следующие моменты: - Тексты должны быть предварительно очищены и подготовлены к использованию в модели BERT. - Тексты должны быть представлены в переменных \`texts\` и \`labels\`. - Максимальная длина входного текста для BERT ограничена, поэтому необходимо обрезать тексты с помощью параметра \`max_length\`. В данном примере установлен \`max_length=512\`, но вы можете изменить его в зависимости от размера вашей GPU и длины текстов. - Используйте метод \`train_test_split()\` из \`sklearn\` для разделения данных на обучающую и тестовую выборки. - Для обучения логистической регрессии используется класс \`LogisticRegression\` библиотеки \`scikit-learn\`. - Чтобы классификатор лучше работал, вы можете настроить его параметры (регуляризация и т.д.) или использовать дополнительно техники, такие как кросс-валидация. - Оценка модели проводится с помощью функции \`classification_report\`, которая предоставит различные метрики классификации (точность, полноту, F1-меру и т.д.). Наконец, учтите, что выполнение этого кода потребует значительных вычислительных ресурсов и может занять много времени, особенно если у вас большой набор данных и нет доступа к GPU."},{"instruction":"как ты думаешь в будущем возможны параллельно работающие операционные системы без ограничения ресурсов?","output":"Возможно, в будущем с развитием технологий и коммуникаций станет возможным создание параллельно работающих операционных систем без ограничения ресурсов.

Однако, необходимо учитывать несколько важных аспектов: 1. Оверхед обработки: процесс сжатия и распаковки данных требует вычислительных ресурсов. Это может увеличить нагрузку на процессор и замедлить работу операционной системы. 2. Потери данных: некоторые методы сжатия могут привести к потере части информации или к ухудшению качества данных. Важно выбирать подходящий алгоритм сжатия, который сохранит целостность данных. 3. Конфиденциальность: при сжатии данных перед записью в постоянную память возникает риск утечки конфиденциальной информации. Необходимо обеспечить адекватную защиту данных от несанкционированного доступа. Хотя сжатие информации перед записью может быть полезным методом для оптимизации использования ресурсов, необходимо внимательно оценить плюсы и минусы этого подхода и учесть все возможные риски."},{"instruction":"“ölene dek kesintisiz her an elimden gelenin en iyisini yapacağım.” bir motivasyon cümlesi olarak bu sözün güçlü ve zayıf yönlerini tartış ve alternatifleri ile kıyasla.","output":"Bu söz, bireyin özverisinin ve kararlılığının altını çizen güçlü bir motivasyon ifadesidir. Bu cümle aynı zamanda kişisel mükemmeliyetçiliği ve sürekli gelişim anlayışını vurgular. Ancak, her cümlenin olduğu gibi, bu ifadenin de güçlü ve zayıf yönleri bulunmaktadır. Güçlü yönleri: 1. Kararlılık: \\"Ölene dek kesintisiz\\" ibaresi, kişinin hedeflerine ulaşmak için sürekli ve uzun vadeli bir taahhütte bulunduğunu ima eder. 2. Azim: \\"Elimden gelenin en iyisini yapacağım.\\" ifadesi, kişinin başarıya ulaşmak için gereken çabayı göstereceğini ve hiçbir zaman yarı yolda bırakmayacağını vurgular. 3. Sorumluluk: Bu cümle, bireyin kendi eylemlerinden ve performansından tam anlamıyla sorumlu olduğunu gösterir. 4. Sürekli gelişme: En iyisini yapma gayreti, kişisel gelişimin sürekli bir süreç olduğunu ve daima daha iyisini yapmaya çalışmanın önemini ifade eder. Zayıf yönleri: 1. Gerçekçilik eksikliği: \\"Kesintisiz\\" ve \\"ölene dek\\" sözleri gerçek hayat dinamikleriyle uyumsuz olabilir. İnsanlar fiziksel ve duygusal sınırlara sahiptir ve sürekli olarak en iyisini yapmak her zaman mümkün olmayabilir. 2. Aşırı baskı: Bu ifade, kişiye aşırı kalıplar dayatıyor olabilir ve bu da stres, tükenmişlik ve huzursuzluğa yol açabilir. 3. Esneklik eksikliği: Hayatın beklenmedik olayları ve değişen koşulları karşısında esnek olmak ve gerektiğinde hedefleri yeniden değerlendirmek önemlidir. Bu cümle, esnek davranış yerine katı bir yaklaşımı teşvik edebilir. 4. Sürdürülebilirlik: Bu ifade, uzun vadede sürdürülebilir olmayan bir motivasyon düzeyini ima etmektedir. Alternatif Motivasyon Cümleleri ve Karşılaştırma: 1. \\"Her gün biraz daha iyi olmak için çaba göstereceğim.\\" Bu cümle, sürekli gelişimi hedeflerken, daha gerçekçi ve günü gününe odaklanan bir yaklaşım sergiler. 2. \\"Zorluklarla karşılaştığımda bile en iyi çözümü bulmak için uğraşacağım.\\" Bu, bireyi en iyisini yapmaya teşvik ederken, esnekliği ve değişime adaptasyonu da göz önünde bulundurur. 3. \\"Başarı için elimden geleni yapacağım ve hatalarımdan öğreneceğim.\\" Burada, kişisel mükemmelliyet hedeflenirken, hataların kaçınılmaz olduğu ve öğrenme fırsatları olduğu kabul edilir. Sonuç olarak, “ölene dek kesintisiz her an elimden gelenin en iyisini yapacağım.” cümlesi, güçlü bir motivasyon ve kararlılık ifadesi olmakla birlikte, gerçekçilik, esneklik ve sürdürülebilirlik açısından zayıf yönleri de vardır. Alternatif cümleler, bu zayıf yönleri adresleyerek daha sağlıklı ve sürdürülebilir motivasyon yolları sunarlar."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee and flower\\"","output":"book and coffee and flower"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Was ist Pin und Flexibilität?","output":"Die Größe bei Skischuhen wird in der Regel in Mondopoint angegeben, was die Länge des Fußes in Zentimetern entspricht. Ein Skischuh in der Größe 27,5 entspricht somit einem Fuß, der 27,5 cm lang ist. Möglicherweise sehen Sie auch traditionelle europäische Schuhgrößen, aber Mondopoint ist für Skischuhe genauer. \\"Pin\\" bezieht sich auf eine Art von Bindungssystem für Skitouren, bekannt als Pin- oder Tech-Bindungen. Diese Bindungen haben spezielle Pins (kleine Metallstifte), die in entsprechende Löcher an der Bindungsaufnahme der speziellen Tourenskischuhe einrasten. Pin-Bindungen sind für ihre Leichtigkeit und Effizienz beim Aufstieg bekannt. Flexibilität, auch Flex genannt, ist ein Maß für die Steifigkeit eines Skischuhs. Sie wird durch eine Flex-Zahl ausgedrückt, die oft von etwa 50 (sehr weich) für Anfänger bis zu 130 oder höher (sehr steif) für erfahrene oder professionelle Skifahrer reicht. Ein steiferer Schuh bietet eine bessere Kraftübertragung und Kontrolle bei hohen Geschwindigkeiten und auf harten Pisten, kann aber auch weniger fehlerverzeihend und bequem sein. Ein weicherer Schuh ist komfortabler und erleichtert das Skifahren bei langsamen Geschwindigkeiten, bietet aber möglicherweise nicht die Präzision und Kontrolle, die fortgeschrittene Skifahrer wünschen."},{"instruction":"Was entspricht 36","output":"Um eine Skischuhgröße im Mondopoint-System für die Fußlänge 36 Zentimeter zu finden, müssen Sie bedenken, dass Skischuhgrößen üblicherweise in halben Zentimeter Schritten angegeben werden. Also, wenn wir von der Größe 36 sprechen, würde das im Mondopoint-System auf eine Größe von 36,0 oder 36,5 hinauslaufen, je nachdem, ob der Hersteller auch genaue ganze Größen anbietet. Da allerdings eine Fußlänge von 36 Zentimetern sehr groß ist und beyond der gängigen Skischuhgrößen liegt, wäre es wahrscheinlicher, dass hier von der konventionellen europäischen Schuhgröße die Rede ist. In dem Fall würde eine europäische Schuhgröße 36 in etwa einer Mondopoint-Größe von 23,0 bis 23,5 cm entsprechen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass bei der Wahl der richtigen Skischuhgröße weitere Faktoren wie der Leistenbreite (Volumen des Schuhes), die Form des Fußes und persönlicher Präferenzen berücksichtigt werden müssen. Denn nicht nur die Länge des Fußes ist entscheidend, sondern auch wie der Schuh insgesamt am Fuß sitzt. Es wird deshalb auch oft empfohlen, die Skischuhe vor dem Kauf anzuprobieren und sich von einem Fachmann beraten zu lassen."},{"instruction":"Leistenbreite messen. Wie","output":"Die Leistenbreite eines Skischuhs, auch als \\"Leistenweite\\" oder \\"Foot Last\\" bekannt, bezieht sich auf die Innweite des Schuhs und gibt an, wie breit der Schuh an der breitesten Stelle des Vorderfußes (Metatarsalbereich) ist. Es ist wichtig, die richtige Leistenbreite zu wählen, damit der Schuh bequem sitzt und eine gute Kontrolle beim Skifahren ermöglicht. Um die Leistenbreite deines Fußes selbst zu messen, kannst du folgende Schritte befolgen: 1. **Vorbereitung:** - Sorge dafür, dass du deine Füße am Ende des Tages misst, wenn sie aufgrund von Aktivitäten leicht angeschwollen sein könnten. - Benutze ein Blatt Papier, das groß genug ist, um deinen gesamten Fuß darauf zu stellen, sowie einen Stift oder Bleistift und ein Maßband oder Lineal. 2. **Fuß positionieren:** - Lege das Papier auf den Boden und stelle einen Fuß barfuß oder in den Socken, die du normalerweise beim Skifahren trägst, darauf. Achte darauf, dass dein Fuß gleichmäßig belastet wird. 3. **Markierung:** - Zeichne mit dem Stift sorgfältig um die gesamte Umrisslinie deines Fußes herum. Es kann hilfreich sein, wenn jemand dir dabei hilft, damit du dich nicht nach vorn lehnst und somit das Gewicht auf deinen Fuß verlagerst. - Markiere insbesondere die breiteste Stelle an beiden Seiten des Vorfußes – also dort, wo der große Zeh beginnt und wo der kleine Zeh endet. 4. **Messen:** - Miss mit dem Maßband den Abstand zwischen den beiden weitesten Markierungen auf dem Papier – das ist die Breite deines Vorfußes. - Wiederhole den Vorgang für den anderen Fuß. 5. **Ergebnis:** - Nutze den größeren der beiden Werte (falls deine Füße unterschiedlich breit sind), um deine Leistenbreite zu bestimmen. Skischuhhersteller geben oft die Leistenbreite ihrer Modelle an, typischerweise in Millimetern, z. B. 98 mm, 100 mm, 102 mm etc. Beachte, dass bestimmte Marken und Modelle unterschiedlich ausfallen können, und verschiedene Leistenformen auf unterschiedliche Fußformen abzielen. Die Leistenbreite ist zudem nicht das einzige Kriterium – auch andere Faktoren wie der Leistenhöhe, der Fersenhalt und das allgemeine Volumen des Schuhs spielen für die Passform eine wichtige Rolle. Deshalb ist eine Anprobe bei einem erfahrenen Bootfitter empfehlenswert, der den Schuh gegebenenfalls noch anpassen kann."},{"instruction":"\\"def classify_image(inp): inp = inp.reshape((-1, 224, 224, 3)) inp = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(inp) prediction = inception_net.predict(inp).flatten() confidences = {labels[i]: float(prediction[i]) for i in range(1000)} return confidences\\" what is the meaning of 1000 in this code?","output":"In the provided Python code snippet, \`1000\` refers to the number of classes that the \`inception_net\` model is predicting. It assumes that \`inception_net\` is a neural network trained to classify images into 1000 different categories, which is commonly the case with models trained on the ImageNet dataset. For example, the original Inception model (Inception v1 or GoogleNet) was trained to classify images into one of 1000 classes. Here is an explanation of each part of the code: - \`inp.reshape((-1, 224, 224, 3))\`: This line reshapes the input image \`inp\` to the appropriate dimensions expected by the model, which is height 224, width 224, and 3 color channels (RGB). The \`-1\` automatically calculates the necessary size for that dimension based on the size of the data. - \`tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(inp)\`: This line preprocesses the input data using the preprocessing function specific to MobileNetV2. This step usually involves scaling the pixel values in a way that matches the preprocessing applied to data during the training of the model. - \`prediction = inception_net.predict(inp).flatten()\`: Here, the preprocessed input \`inp\` is fed to the \`inception_net\` model to make a prediction. The output predictions are then flattened, meaning that if the predictions were initially outputted as a 2D array where rows represent different images and columns represent confidence scores for each class, \`flatten()\` turns it into a 1D array containing the confidence scores for all classes. - \`confidences = {labels[i]: float(prediction[i]) for i in range(1000)}\`: This line creates a dictionary where each key-value pair is a label and its corresponding predicted confidence. \`labels\` is assumed to be a list of string labels of length \`1000\`, one for each class that the inception_net model can identify. The confidences are extracted from the \`prediction\` array, converted to a float (in case they are not already), and put into the dictionary with their corresponding label. The \`1000\` inside the \`range()\` function is used to iterate over all possible class indices that the \`inception_net\` model can predict. It is essential that the size of \`labels\` matches the number of classes the model predicts, in this case, \`1000\` labels for \`1000\` classes. If \`labels\` contains fewer or more than \`1000\` elements, this code will raise an index out of bounds error or will not include all possible labels, respectively."},{"instruction":"Czy biuro księgowe, biuro rachunkowe, doradca podatkowy są instytucjami, które są w stanie pomóc mi w sprawie wypełnienia dokumentów do ZUS-u w celu zakupu dobrowolnego ubezpieczenia zdrowotnego?","output":"Tak, biuro księgowe, biuro rachunkowe oraz doradca podatkowy mogą pomóc Ci w wypełnieniu dokumentów do ZUS-u w celu zakupu dobrowolnego ubezpieczenia zdrowotnego.

Here are some methods: 1. **Manual Search:** If your project is not too large, you might simply search the codebase for the import statement manually using an editor or an IDE that supports searching across files. 2. **\`grep\` Command:** If you're using a Unix-like system, you can use the \`grep\` command to search for import declarations in the Go files. Replace \`your/package/path\` with the import path of the package you're looking for: \`\`\`sh grep -R \\"your/package/path\\" /path/to/your/project \`\`\` 3. **Go tooling:** You can use \`go list\` with the \`-json\` flag to list all the dependencies of your project which also include where they are imported, but it won't show you the exact file: \`\`\`sh go list -json ./... | jq '.Deps[]' | grep \\"your/package/path\\" \`\`\` **Note:** This requires \`jq\` to be installed, which is a command-line JSON processor. 4. **IDE Features:** Modern IDEs like Visual Studio Code with the Go extension, GoLand, or even Atom with the appropriate Go plugins, provide features to find references to a specific package or symbol across your project. - For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can right-click the import statement and select \\"Find All References\\" to see where it's being used. 5. **gowhere**: This is a simple tool (you might need to install it) that can be used to show where a Go package is being imported: \`\`\`sh go get -u github.com/josharian/gowhere gowhere your/package/path \`\`\` This tool will recursively traverse all Go files in your \`GOPATH\` and print out where they are imported. 6. **guru**: The \`guru\` tool can be used to find references to a particular identifier (this could be a function, type, package, etc.) in your workspace. Install the tool and use the \`referrers\` mode: \`\`\`sh go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru guru referrers your/package/path.Identifier \`\`\` Replace \`your/package/path.Identifier\` with the actual package import path and identifier you are interested in. 7. **go mod why**: If you're using Go modules, \`go mod why\` can help you understand why a particular package is included in the module dependencies: \`\`\`sh go mod why -m your/package/path \`\`\` While \`grep\` and manual search can help you find where packages are used in the code, Go tooling and IDE support might yield more detailed information and may be more efficient for larger codebases."},{"instruction":"How to run Invision Community locally, where to download it ?","output":"Invision Community (formerly known as IP.Board or Invision Power Board) is a commercial Internet forum software and community suite written in PHP.

Bu tür ifadeler, kişisel gelişim ve motivasyon konusunda sıkça kullanılan yöntemlerdir. Şimdi bu cümlenin güçlü ve zayıf yönlerini inceleyelim: **Güçlü Yönler:** 1. **Kararlılık**: \\"Ölene dek\\" ifadesi, uzun vadeli bir kararlılık ve taahhüt hissi uyandırır. Bu ifade bireyi, hedeflerinden şaşmamak konusunda güçlendirir. 2. **Tam Potansiyel**: \\"Elimden gelenin en iyisini yapacağım\\" kısmı, kişinin her zaman tam potansiyelini hedeflemesini önerir, bu da mükemmel bir çalışma ahlakını ve kendini sürekli geliştirme isteğini temsil eder. 3. **Kesintisizlik**: \\"Kesintisiz her an\\" ifadesi süreklilik ve disiplini vurgular. Bu düzenli çaba gösterme fikri, uzun vadeli başarıya ulaşmanın temel bir unsurudur. **Zayıf Yönler:** 1. **Gerçekçilik Eksikliği**: \\"Ölene dek\\" ve \\"kesintisiz her an\\" ifadeleri çok aşırı ve sürdürülebilir olmayan standartlar belirler. İnsanlar enerjileri ve motivasyonları doğal olarak dalgalanan canlı varlıklardır ve her zaman maksimum kapasitelerinde çalışamayabilirler. 2. **Basınç ve Stres**: Kendine sürekli en iyisini yapmak gibi bir yük yüklemek, kişide ciddi stres ve basınca yol açabilir. Bu baskı, yanma sendromuna (burnout) ve tükenmişliğe davetiye çıkarabilir. 3. **Esneklik Eksikliği**: Hayatta beklenmedik olaylar ve değişiklikler meydana gelebilir. Bu kadar kesin ve katı bir hedef belirlemek, adaptasyon ve esnekliğe izin vermez. **Alternatifler ve Karşılaştırmalar:** 1. **Realist Hedefler**: \\"Elimden geleni yapacağım ve sürekli olarak gelişimi hedefleyeceğim.\\" Bu ifade benzer bir motivasyonu iletmekle birlikte, her zaman maksimum performans beklentisi yerine sürekli gelişim odaklı daha realist bir anlayış sunar. 2. **Esnek Yaklaşımlar**: \\"Zor zamanlar geldiğinde güçlü kalacağım ve mümkün olan en iyi kararları vermeye çalışacağım.\\" Bu ifade, zorluklarla karşılaşıldığında esnek olunacağını ve en iyisini yapma çabasını vurgular, ama her an mükemmel olmasının gerekmediğini kabul eder. 3. **Dengeli Yaşam**: \\"İşimde ve yaşamımda dengeli bir şekilde başarı ve mutluluğu arayacağım.\\" Bu yaklaşım, sürekli en iyiyi yapmayı amaçlarken, aynı zamanda kişisel sağlık ve mutluluk gibi diğer önemli yaşam alanlarını ihmal etmeme önemini de vurgular. Sonuç olarak, motivasyon cümleleri kişinin hedeflerine ulaşmasında önemli bir rol oynar, ancak bu ifadelerin gerçekçi, sürdürülebilir ve bireysel ihtiyaçlara uygun olması önemlidir. Kişisel gelişim, çabalar arasında dengeli bir yaklaşım ile daha sağlıklı ve verimli olabilir."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

March 5, 2024 Authors Greg Brockman Ilya Sutskever John Schulman Sam Altman Wojciech Zaremba OpenAI Announcements The mission of OpenAI is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, which means both building safe and beneficial AGI and helping create broadly distributed benefits. We are now sharing what we've learned about achieving our mission, and some facts about our relationship with Elon. We intend to move to dismiss all of Elon’s claims. We realized building AGI will require far more resources than we’d initially imagined Elon said we should announce an initial 1B funding commitment to OpenAI. In total, the non-profit has raised less than 45M from Elon and more than 90M from other donors. When starting OpenAI in late 2015, Greg and Sam had initially planned to raise 100M. Elon said in an email: “We need to go with a much bigger number than 100M to avoid sounding hopeless… I think we should say that we are starting with a 1B funding commitment… I will cover whatever anyone else doesn't provide.” [1] We spent a lot of time trying to envision a plausible path to AGI. In early 2017, we came to the realization that building AGI will require vast quantities of compute. We began calculating how much compute an AGI might plausibly require. We all understood we were going to need a lot more capital to succeed at our mission—billions of dollars per year, which was far more than any of us, especially Elon, thought we’d be able to raise as the non-profit. We and Elon recognized a for-profit entity would be necessary to acquire those resources As we discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, Elon wanted us to merge with Tesla or he wanted full control. Elon left OpenAI, saying there needed to be a relevant competitor to Google/DeepMind and that he was going to do it himself. He said he’d be supportive of us finding our own path. In late 2017, we and Elon decided the next step for the mission was to create a for-profit entity. Elon wanted majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO. In the middle of these discussions, he withheld funding. Reid Hoffman bridged the gap to cover salaries and operations. We couldn’t agree to terms on a for-profit with Elon because we felt it was against the mission for any individual to have absolute control over OpenAI. He then suggested instead merging OpenAI into Tesla. In early February 2018, Elon forwarded us an email suggesting that OpenAI should “attach to Tesla as its cash cow”, commenting that it was “exactly right… Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn’t zero”. [2] Elon soon chose to leave OpenAI, saying that our probability of success was 0, and that he planned to build an AGI competitor within Tesla. When he left in late February 2018, he told our team he was supportive of us finding our own path to raising billions of dollars. In December 2018, Elon sent us an email saying “Even raising several hundred million won’t be enough. This needs billions per year immediately or forget it.” [3] We advance our mission by building widely-available beneficial tools We’re making our technology broadly usable in ways that empower people and improve their daily lives, including via open-source contributions. We provide broad access to today's most powerful AI, including a free version that hundreds of millions of people use every day. For example, Albania is using OpenAI’s tools to accelerate its EU accession by as much as 5.5 years; Digital Green is helping boost farmer income in Kenya and India by dropping the cost of agricultural extension services 100x by building on OpenAI; Lifespan, the largest healthcare provider in Rhode Island, uses GPT-4 to simplify its surgical consent forms from a college reading level to a 6th grade one; Iceland is using GPT-4 to preserve the Icelandic language. Elon understood the mission did not imply open-sourcing AGI. As Ilya told Elon: “As we get closer to building AI, it will make sense to start being less open. The Open in openAI means that everyone should benefit from the fruits of AI after its built, but it's totally OK to not share the science...”, to which Elon replied: “Yup”. [4] We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired—someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without him. We are focused on advancing our mission and have a long way to go. As we continue to make our tools better and better, we are excited to deploy these systems so they empower every individual. Update March 11, 2024: We are seeking to have the lawsuit assigned to dedicated case management, since it involves AI technology and the claims span almost a decade.

I'd favor positioning the blog to appeal a bit more to the general public -- there is a lot of value to having the public root for us to succeed -- and then having a longer, more detailed and inside-baseball version for recruiting, with a link to it at the end of the general public version. We need to go with a much bigger number than 100M to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending. I think we should say that we are starting with a 1B funding commitment.

Begin forwarded message: From: <> To: Elon Musk <> Date: January 31, 2018 at 11:54:30 PM PST Subject: Re: Top AI institutions today Working at the cutting edge of AI is unfortunately expensive. For example,In addition to DeepMind, Google also has Google Brain, Research, and Cloud. And TensorFlow, TPUs, and they own about a third of all research (in fact, they hold their own AI conferences). I also strongly suspect that compute horsepower will be necessary (and possibly even sufficient) to reach AGI. If historical trends are any indication, progress in AI is primarily driven by systems - compute, data, infrastructure. The core algorithms we use today have remained largely unchanged from the ~90s. Not only that, but any algorithmic advances published in a paper somewhere can be almost immediately re-implemented and incorporated. Conversely, algorithmic advances alone are inert without the scale to also make them scary. It seems to me that OpenAI today is burning cash and that the funding model cannot reach the scale to seriously compete with Google (an 800B company). If you can't seriously compete but continue to do research in open, you might in fact be making things worse and helping them out “for free”, because any advances are fairly easy for them to copy and immediately incorporate, at scale. A for-profit pivot might create a more sustainable revenue stream over time and would, with the current team, likely bring in a lot of investment. However, building out a product from scratch would steal focus from AI research, it would take a long time and it's unclear if a company could “catch up” to Google scale, and the investors might exert too much pressure in the wrong directions.The most promising option I can think of, as I mentioned earlier, would be for OpenAI to attach to Tesla as its cash cow. I believe attachments to other large suspects (e.g. Apple? Amazon?) would fail due to an incompatible company DNA. Using a rocket analogy, Tesla already built the “first stage” of the rocket with the whole supply chain of Model 3 and its onboard computer and a persistent internet connection. The “second stage” would be a full self driving solution based on large-scale neural network training, which OpenAI expertise could significantly help accelerate. With a functioning full self-driving solution in ~2-3 years we could sell a lot of cars/trucks. If we do this really well, the transportation industry is large enough that we could increase Tesla's market cap to high O(~100K), and use that revenue to fund the AI work at the appropriate scale. I cannot see anything else that has the potential to reach sustainable Google-scale capital within a decade.

Congratulations on landing the Falcon 9, what an amazing achievement. Time to build out the fleet now! I've seen you (and Sam and other OpenAI people) doing a lot of interviews recently extolling the virtues of open sourcing AI, but I presume you realise that this is not some sort of panacea that will somehow magically solve the safety problem? There are many good arguments as to why the approach you are taking is actually very dangerous and in fact may increase the risk to the world. Some of the more obvious points are well articulated in this blog post, that I'm sure you've seen, but there are also other important considerations: http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/17/should-ai-be-open/ I’d be interested to hear your counter-arguments to these points.

In 2015, OpenAI sought to raise 100 million, but Musk suggested starting with a 1B commitment to avoid looking ineffective compared to tech giants like Google and Facebook. Eventually, Musk and OpenAI underscored the need for more capital, potentially billions per year, to build AGI. Discussions around creating a for-profit entity to secure these resources led to a deadlock, with Musk desiring significant control over OpenAI – something the founders felt was against their mission. As a result, Musk left OpenAI in early 2018 to start his own AGI effort within Tesla and later expressed skepticism about OpenAI's chance of success without substantial funding. Despite these challenges, OpenAI has continued to build and release beneficial AI tools widely used across various sectors, such as healthcare and language preservation. The blog references several emails from Musk, revealing discussions about funding, business strategy, and the philosophy around open-sourcing AI technology. The OpenAI team expresses disappointment over Musk's lawsuit but remains committed to their mission and advancing their tools to empower individuals.

Это произведение занимает особое место в творчестве писателя, так как является ярким примером его умения рассказать о глубоких эмоциях простыми, но мощными средствами.<br/><br/>Отзыв:<br/><br/>“Тоска” Чехова представляет собой мастерски написанный рассказ, который обращает внимание на универсальную тему человеческой одиночества и непонимания. Основной герой рассказа – ивощник Иона Потапов, который испытывает невыносимую боль потери своего сына. Чехов мастерски передает отчаяние и внутреннюю пустоту главного героя. Иона пытается поделиться своим горем с пассажирами, что только подчеркивает его изоляцию и социальное отчуждение.<br/><br/>Чехов демонстрирует свой особенный стиль через экономичный язык, но при этом каждая деталь, каждое слово в рассказе несет в себе важный смысл и вес. Проза писателя запоминается образностью и тонкой психологией, позволяющей читателю глубоко сочувствовать персонажу. Чувство тоски ощущается на протяжении всего произведения, делая его вечером мрачным и задушевным одновременно.<br/><br/>“Тоска” представляет собой тонкую социальную критику, актуальную до сих пор, поскольку многие люди сталкиваются с одиночеством и отсутствием эмпатии в современном обществе. Эта работа в очередной раз подтверждает гениальность Чехова как наблюдателя жизни и художника слова. Она заставляет задуматься о важности доброты, внимания и душевного тепла в общении с нашими близкими и случайными собеседниками.USER: Напиши план по биографии Сергея Александровича ЕсенинаASSISTANT: План биографии Сергея Александровича Есенина:<br/><br/>1.

Оно является ключевой темой произведения и отражает одну из центральных идей автора о том, что человеческое достоинство и моральные качества не зависят от финансового положения.<br/><br/>Вывод о данной теме может звучать следующим образом:<br/><br/>“Выражение ‘Бедность не порок’ подчёркивает, что бедность как социальное явление не должна становиться причиной для презрения или дискриминации человека. В комедии Островского это выражение становится моральным лейтмотивом, который выступает против связи человеческой ценности с материальным благосостоянием. В контексте пьесы бедность обнажает истинные человеческие качества – доброту, честность, верность принципам, в то время как достаток может сосуществовать с моральным упадком и эгоизмом. Таким образом, важна не столько внешняя оболочка социального статуса, сколько внутренний нравственный склад личности. Эта мысль актуальна и в наше время, когда оценка человеческих качеств всё ещё нередко происходит через призму его финансовых возможностей.”USER: Расскажи о причинах межнациональных конфликтов в ЮгославииASSISTANT: Межнациональные конфликты в Югославии, приведшие к её распаду в начале 1990-х годов, были результатом сложного взаимодействия исторических, политических, экономических и социальных факторов. Вот некоторые ключевые причины этих конфликтов:<br/><br/>1. Исторические различия: Югославия была государством, объединившим несколько национальностей, каждая из которых имела свою уникальную историю, культуру и традиции, а также различные религиозные принадлежности (православие, католичество, ислам). Многовековая история конфликтов и кровопролития между этими группами, в том числе во время Второй мировой войны, способствовала недоверию и напряжённости.<br/><br/>2. Национализм: Конец холодной войны и ослабление тоталитарных режимов в Восточной Европе подстегнули всплеск националистических чувств среди различных этнических групп Югославии. Лидеры этих групп, стремясь к политической власти, использовали национализм для мобилизации населения и обострения внутренних противоречий.<br/><br/>3. Экономика: Различия в экономическом развитии регионов Югославии также подливали масло в огонь. Некоторые более развитые области, такие как Словения и Хорватия, стремились к большей экономической независимости, в то время как менее развитые республики опасались утраты субсидий и поддержки из федерального бюджета.<br/><br/>4. Политическое управление: Смерть долголетнего лидера Югославии, Йосипа Броз Тито, в 1980 году оставила за собой вакуум власти и привела к ослаблению централизованной государственной структуры, подчеркивающей равновесие между различными национальностями. Это поспособствовало росту сепаратистских настроений.<br/><br/>5. Внешнее вмешательство: Вмешательство иностранных держав и организаций, которые по своим стратегическим и политическим соображениям поддерживали ту или иную сторону, также сыграло роль в разжигании и поддержании конфликта.<br/><br/>6. Религиозные конфликты: Различные религии, исповедуемые населением Югославии, служили в качестве одного из факторов, углубляющих межэтническое разделение.<br/><br/>7. Падение коммунизма: Общий кризис коммунистической идеологии в остальной Восточной Европе подорвал легитимность социалистического федеративного строя Югославии, что способствовало её распаду.<br/><br/>Все эти факторы вместе привели к серии кровопролитных войн, этническим чисткам и в итоге — к распаду Югославии на отдельные независимые государства с последующей долговременной нестабильностью в регионе.USER: Реши задачу. Периметр равнобедренного треугольника равен 216, а боковая сторона - 78. Найдите площадь треугольника.ASSISTANT: Для решения этой задачи нам нужно сначала найти основание равнобедренного треугольника, затем используя его, вычислить высоту треугольника, опущенную на основание, и, в конце концов, площадь треугольника.<br/><br/>Периметр равнобедренного треугольника равен сумме его трёх сторон: двух боковых и основания. Пусть ( b ) – основание треугольника, тогда:<br/><br/>[ P = b + 2 cdot s ]<br/>[ 216 = b + 2 cdot 78 ]<br/>[ 216 = b + 156 ]<br/>[ b = 216 - 156 ]<br/>[ b = 60 ]<br/><br/>Теперь, когда мы знаем боковую сторону ( s = 78 ) и основание ( b = 60 ), можем найти высоту ( h ) треугольника. Высота, опущенная на основание равнобедренного треугольника, делит его на два прямоугольных треугольника. В каждом из этих треугольников высота будет являться одним из катетов, основание будет разделено пополам, поэтому вторым катетом будет ( frac{b}{2} = frac{60}{2} = 30 ), а гипотенузой будет боковая сторона равная ( s = 78 ). Используя теорему Пифагора, найдём высоту ( h ):<br/><br/>[ h^2 + left(frac{b}{2}right)^2 = s^2 ]<br/>[ h^2 + 30^2 = 78^2 ]<br/>[ h^2 + 900 = 6084 ]<br/>[ h^2 = 6084 - 900 ]<br/>[ h^2 = 5184 ]<br/>[ h = sqrt{5184} ]<br/>[ h = 72 ]<br/><br/>Теперь можно найти площадь ( S ) равнобедренного треугольника по формуле для площади треугольника, где ( b ) – основание, а ( h ) – высота:<br/><br/>[ S = frac{1}{2} cdot b cdot h ]<br/>[ S = frac{1}{2} cdot 60 cdot 72 ]<br/>[ S = 30 cdot 72 ]<br/>[ S = 2160 ]<br/><br/>Ответ: Площадь треугольника равна 2160 квадратных единиц.USER: Вы часто слышали, наверное, как люди в пожеланиях друг другу говорят о \\"кавказском долголетии\\". Выскажите свои суждения о природе феномена долгожительства у кавказских народов.ASSISTANT: Феномен кавказского долголетия – это понятие, обусловленное известностью Кавказа как региона с высокой долей долгожителей среди населения. Это явление привлекло внимание научного сообщества, исследователей и широкой общественности. Существует множество гипотез и предположений почему народы Кавказа отличаются продолжительностью жизни. Ниже представлены некоторые суждения и предположения о природе этого феномена:<br/><br/>1. Генетический фактор: Считается, что у некоторых народностей Кавказа могут быть генетические особенности, способствующие долголетию.<br/><br/>2. Экологическая среда: Чистый горный воздух, отсутствие крупных промышленных предприятий и экологические условия Кавказа могут благоприятно влиять на здоровье и продолжительность жизни.<br/><br/>3. Пищевые привычки: Традиционная кавказская кухня богата овощами, фруктами, бобовыми, травами и молочными продуктами, что может положительно влиять на здоровье.<br/><br/>4. Физическая активность: Горная местность требует от жителей активности и постоянного физического труда, что способствует укреплению здоровья и выносливости.<br/><br/>5. Социально-культурные аспекты: Крепкие семейные узы, уважение к старшим поколениям и активная общественная жизнь также могут способствовать удовлетворенности жизнью и, как следствие, более долгому существованию.<br/><br/>6. Режим дня и отношение к здоровью: Традиционный образ жизни, включающий регулярный и умеренный ритм, может благоприятно сказываться на продолжительности жизни.<br/><br/>Тем не менее, необходимо отметить, что эти суждения основаны чаще на анекдотических свидетельствах и гипотезах и требуют научного изучения и подтверждения. Кроме того, долголетие – это результат взаимодействия множества факторов, и оно не ограничивается только кавказским регионом.USER: Приведите примеры материальной культуры горских народов, которые определены особенностями природыASSISTANT: Материальная культура горских народов тесно связана с природными условиями и ландшафтом, в котором они проживают. Примеры материальной культуры, определенной особенностями природы, включают:<br/><br/>1. Архитектура и жилище: Горские дома часто строятся из местных материалов, таких как камень и дерево, что обеспечивает их устойчивость в суровых горных условиях. Крыши обычно имеют крутой наклон, чтобы снег не скапливался на них зимой.<br/><br/>2. Одежда: Традиционная одежда горских народов утеплена и приспособлена для защиты от холодного воздуха и ветра, часто с использованием шерсти и кожи местных животных.<br/><br/>3. Сельскохозяйственные техники: Горные народы разработали уникальные методы выращивания сельскохозяйственных культур на склонах холмов и в узких долинах, в том числе террасирование для предотвращения эрозии почвы.<br/><br/>4. Инструменты и орудия труда: Особенности горного ландшафта требуют создания специализированных инструментов, например, для работ в условиях крутых склонов или для обработки каменистой почвы.<br/><br/>5. Пищевые традиции: Диета горских народов включает продукты, доступные или выращиваемые в горных условиях, такие как молочные продукты (сыры, кисломолочные продукты), мясо горных животных и культуры, выдерживающие суровый климат.<br/><br/>6. Транспорт: В труднодоступных горных районах до появления современных транспортных средств широко использовались животные, такие как лошади и мулы, которые способны передвигаться по крутым и узким тропам.<br/><br/>Эти примеры показывают, как тяжёлые условия и ограничения, налагаемые природой, формируют особенности материальной культуры горских народов, обусловливая создание уникальных и адаптированных к окружающей среде артефактов и технологий.USER: Изучение приспособление организмов к определенной среде обитанияASSISTANT: Изучение приспособления организмов к определенной среде обитания является ключевой темой в области экологии и эволюционной биологии. Приспособление, или адаптация, позволяет организмам лучше выживать и успешно размножаться во встречающихся им экологических условиях. Изучение адаптаций помогает ученым понять, как различные виды со временем эволюционируют, чтобы справляться с физическими факторами окружающей среды, изменениями климата, конкуренцией за ресурсы, хищниками и другими угрозами, которые могут повлиять на их выживание.<br/><br/>Адаптации могут быть различных типов:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Морфологические адаптации</strong> – изменения в структуре или внешнем виде организма. Примером может служить утолщенное пальто меха у млекопитающих, живущих в холодном климате, или длинные корни растений в засушливой среде для доступа к воде на более глубоких уровнях почвы.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Физиологические адаптации</strong> – изменения во внутренних функциях организма, например, способность к обезвоживанию или выработке антифриза в клетках у некоторых животных, обеспечивающих выживание при экстремально низких температурах.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Поведенческие адаптации</strong> – изменения в поведении, позволяющие организмам лучше приспособиться, такие как сезонные миграции птиц для избегания холода или эстивация (длительный сон) животных во время засухи.<br/><br/>Исследования адаптаций могут включать полевые наблюдения, лабораторные эксперименты, генетический анализ и математическое моделирование. Эти исследования помогают ученым понять, как осуществляется процесс естественного отбора, который является движущей силой эволюции, и какие факторы способствуют разнообразию видов на Земле.<br/><br/>Таким образом, приспособление организмов к определенной среде обитания является важным элементом для поддержания биоразнообразия и динамики экосистем. Это изучение также критически важно для сохранения видов и их окружающей среды, особенно в контексте глобальных экологических изменений.USER: Изучение приспособление белого медведя к определенной среде обитанияASSISTANT: Белый медведь, также известный как полярный медведь (Ursus maritimus), является великолепным примером специализированной адаптации организма к экстремальным условиям арктической среды обитания. Он обладает рядом уникальных адаптаций, позволяющих ему выживать в суровых условиях Северного полюса:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Морфологические адаптации</strong>:<br/> - <strong>Толстый слой жира</strong>: У белых медведей существует слой жира толщиной до 11 см, который действует как изоляция от холодных температур и предоставляет резервное энергетическое запасание.<br/> - <strong>Водонепроницаемая и тёплая шерсть</strong>: Медведи покрыты толстой шерстью, которая отталкивает воду и удерживает тепло, что позволяет им переносить низкие температуры и длительное время находиться в холодной воде.<br/> - <strong>Белый цвет шерсти</strong>: Белая шерсть обеспечивает камуфляж в снежной и ледяной среде, что важно как для охоты, так и для защиты.<br/> - <strong>Широкие шершавые лапы</strong>: Белые медведи имеют большие лапы, которые распределяют их вес для лучшего хождения по снегу и льду, а также помогают им в плавании.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Физиологические адаптации</strong>:<br/> - <strong>Управление температурой тела</strong>: Способность поддерживать постоянную температуру тела даже при очень низких температурах окружающей среды.<br/> - <strong>Эффективное переваривание жира</strong>: Пищевой рацион белого медведя состоит в основном из жирной пищи (такой как тюлени), а их организмы приспособлены для высокоэффективного усваивания жира и преобразования его в энергию и тепло.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Поведенческие адаптации</strong>:<br/> - <strong>Охотничьи навыки</strong>: Белые медведи разработали сложные и эффективные стратегии охоты, включая поджидание у дыр во льду, чтобы поймать добычу, когда та поднимется дышать.<br/> - <strong>Длительное умеренное голодание</strong>: Периоды, когда пищи мало, требуют от белого медведя способности длительное время обходиться без пищи, используя свои жировые запасы для выживания.<br/><br/>Белый медведь является специализированным хищником, зависимым от морского льда как платформы для охоты на свою основную добычу. Однако изменение климата и таяние морского льда создают проблемы для их выживания, подчеркивая необходимость защиты их арктической среды обитания.USER: Напиши выводы Матрёнин дворASSISTANT: “Матрёнин двор” – это рассказ нобелевского лауреата Александра Солженицына, описывающий жизнь простой сельской женщины, Матрёны Васильевны, в послевоенной советской России. Рассказ обращает внимание на вопросы морали, гуманизма и сочувствия, раскрывая жестокость и бездушие тоталитарного режима и его влияние на обыденную жизнь людей.<br/><br/>Выводы из “Матрёнин двор” могут касаться таких тем:<br/><br/>1. Подлинная жертвенность и доброта: Матрёна Васильевна, несмотря на свою бедность и тяжёлую судьбу, остается беззаветно добрым человеком, всегда готовым прийти на помощь соседям.<br/><br/>2. Критика советской системы: Солженицын освещает несправедливость существующего порядка, где старание и честный труд не ценятся, а бюрократия и обезличенность системы доводят до абсурда человеческие отношения.<br/><br/>3. Отсутствие взаимности: В обществе, где каждый занят выживанием, редко кто способен отвечать на доброту добротой. Матрёна живёт в окружении, где её жертвенность не находит должного понимания и восприятия.<br/><br/>4. Размышления о ценности человеческой жизни и забвения: Рассказ вызывает вопросы о том, сколько жертв остаётся невидимыми и непризнанными, и сколь много жизней обесцениваются и забываются.<br/><br/>5. Парадокс бескорыстия: Рассказ показывает парадокс – Матрёна, олицетворяющая лучшие человеческие качества, страдает больше всех, что поднимает вопрос о нравственном порядке в мире и справедливости.<br/><br/>“Матрёнин двор” заставляет задуматься о вечных ценностях, о важности отдавать человеческому теплу и состраданию то место в жизни общества, которого они заслуживают. Это произведение глубоко трогает читателя, заставляя переосмыслить собственные жизненные приоритеты и значение каждой индивидуальной жизни в широком социальном контексте.USER: Расскажи об основных направлениях внешней политики КНРASSISTANT:","output":"Основные направления внешней политики Китайской Народной Республики (КНР) основаны на принципах мирного сосуществования и акцентируются на поддержании и расширении своего глобального влияния. Вот некоторые ключевые аспекты: 1. **Многосторонний подход**: КНР стремится укреплять своё положение в международных организациях, таких как Организация Объединенных Наций, Шанхайская организация сотрудничества, БРИКС и другие. 2. **Экономическая дипломатия**: Китай активно развивает экономические связи, часто используя инвестиции и торговлю как средство внешнеполитического воздействия. Инициатива \\"Один пояс, один путь\\" (Belt and Road Initiative) является примером этого, стремясь создать инфраструктурную сеть, соединяющую Китай с другими частями мира. 3. **Решение региональных конфликтов и урегулирование споров**: КНР стремится играть более активную роль в региональных делах, включая политическое урегулирование на Корейском полуострове, участие в миротворческих минированиях и урегулирование территориальных споров в Южно-Китайском море. 4. **Культурный обмен и \\"мягкая сила\\"**: Китай наращивает свое культурное присутствие через деятельность Конфуциевых институтов и других платформ, продвигая свои язык и культуру как инструменты мягкого влияния. 5. **Наука и техника**: КНР стремится к сотрудничеству в области науки и высоких технологий, укладывая двусторонние соглашения и участвуя в международных исследовательских проектах. 6. **Стратегические партнёрства**: Китай ведёт активную двустороннюю дипломатию, включая стратегическое военное и экономическое сотрудничество, особенно с развивающимися странами Азии, Африки и Латинской Америки. 7. **Защита национальных интересов**: Как крупная мировая держава, КНР решительно защищает свои национальные интересы на международной арене, включая вопросы, связанные с Тайванем, Тибетом и Синьцзяном. 8. **Климатические изменения и экология**: Китай активизировал усилия по борьбе с изменением климата и участвует в международных усилиях по охране окружающей среды, включая Парижское соглашение."},{"instruction":"george washington, abraham lincoln, and donald trump walks into a bar…finish the joke","output":"George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Donald Trump walk into a bar.

Some of these toys are your favorites and some you don't play with much. Salience is like when you really notice and pay attention to your favorite toys. They stand out to you because they're important to you or because they're super colorful or make a cool noise. So, if something is \\"salient,\\" it's like your favorite toy that catches your eye and makes you want to play with it. Sentience, on the other hand, is like if one of your toys could feel things and think for itself. If you had a teddy bear that could feel sad when it's left alone and happy when you give it a hug, that teddy bear would be \\"sentient.\\" It's like in cartoons when animals or toys have their own thoughts and feelings and seem alive. So, remember, salience is about how much something stands out to you, and sentience is about being able to feel and think all on your own!"},{"instruction":"not salience but sapience","output":"Oops! Let's go over that again in a way that's easy to understand. Imagine you have a really smart robot that you play with. It can talk to you, make decisions, and even play games using its robot brain. Sapience is like how smart and wise the robot is. If the robot can think about tough questions, make smart choices, and understand complicated things, it's showing \\"sapience.\\" It's like when someone is really good at figuring things out and knows a lot. Sentience is like if your robot could also feel things. Maybe it gets happy when you play with it or sad when it's left in the closet. If your robot can feel happy, sad, or scared, it has \\"sentience\\" – it can feel feelings, just like you do. So, sapience is about being wise and smart, like a super clever robot, and sentience is about having feelings, like if the robot can be happy or sad."},{"instruction":"explain like i’m five astrophysics vs astrology","output":"Okay, imagine you're looking up at the night sky full of stars. Astrophysics is like being a space detective. It's when people use math and science to learn about how stars, planets, and galaxies work. They try to solve big space puzzles, like how the stars get their twinkle, why planets go round and round, and what the sun is made up of. Astrology is more like a story that some people think stars and planets tell about our lives. It's like when someone says, \\"The stars say you're going to have a good day today,\\" or \\"People born when this star is in the sky are brave and strong.\\" Astrology is not science, but more of an old way people try to connect what happens in the sky with what happens in our lives, like a game of make-believe with stars and planets. So, astrophysics is the serious study of space using science, and astrology is like a game of stories about stars and us!"},{"instruction":"explain like i’m five wokeness","output":"Okay, let's say you are in a big playground with lots of kids.

Now imagine that some kids don't get a turn on the swings, or they get left out of games because they look different or because they come from another part of town. Being \\"woke\\" is like when you notice that some kids aren't being treated fairly or kindly, and you decide to help them and make sure everyone gets a turn and has fun together. It means you understand that it's important for everyone to be included and treated nicely, no matter what they look like or where they come from.

Luego, ejecuta el siguiente comando para crear un archivo con la lista de paquetes instalados (usualmente llamado \`requirements.txt\`): \`\`\` pip freeze > requirements.txt \`\`\` Este comando exportará todas las dependencias instaladas en tu entorno virtual o entorno global a un archivo de texto. 2. **Copiar el archivo de requerimientos**: Copia el archivo \`requirements.txt\` generado en el paso anterior al nuevo proyecto donde quieres tener los mismos paquetes. 3. **Instalar los paquetes en el nuevo proyecto**: En el nuevo proyecto, asegúrate de que estás en el entorno virtual correcto (si estás utilizando uno) y luego instala los paquetes utilizando el archivo \`requirements.txt\`. Para hacerlo, abre la terminal en PyCharm y ejecuta: \`\`\` pip install -r requirements.txt \`\`\` Esto instalará todas las dependencias listadas en el archivo en tu nuevo proyecto. Si estás utilizando entornos virtuales (lo cual es una buena práctica), asegúrate de activar el entorno virtual correspondiente antes de ejecutar el comando \`pip install\`. Además, PyCharm tiene su propia interfaz de usuario para manejo de paquetes. También puedes usar esta interfaz para instalar paquetes a partir de un \`requirements.txt\`. En caso de que quieras hacerlo de esta manera, sigue los siguientes pasos: 1. **Abre la configuración de PyCharm**: \`File\` > \`Settings\` (en Windows/Linux) o \`PyCharm\` > \`Preferences\` (en macOS). 2. **Ve a Project**: \`TuProyecto\` > \`Python Interpreter\`. 3. **Haz clic en el ícono** del paquete en la parte inferior de la ventana y selecciona \\"Manage Repositories\\". 4. **Haz clic en el ícono** de engranaje en la ventana emergente y selecciona \\"Add from requirements file\\". 5. **Navega hasta tu archivo** \`requirements.txt\` que copiaste de tu proyecto anterior y ábrelo. 6. **PyCharm** procesará el archivo y te permitirá instalar los paquetes listados.

Debe ser exactamente así: \`\`\`python if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": \`\`\` 2. **Revisa la clase \`BiometricTableImporter\`**: Asegúrate de que la clase \`BiometricTableImporter\` y su método \`import_table()\` están definidos correctamente. Si la clase no está definida, recibirás un error de \`NameError\`. 3. **Verifica las importaciones**: Si estás utilizando la librería \`pandas\` u otras librerías en la clase \`BiometricTableImporter\`, asegúrate de que están importadas correctamente al inicio de tu archivo: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd \`\`\` 4. **Revisa la definición de la clase y el método**: Si el método \`import_table()\` no está definido correctamente dentro de la clase \`BiometricTableImporter\` o si la clase tiene errores, recibirás un mensaje de error. Un ejemplo mínimo de cómo debería verse tu archivo Python en PyCharm sería: \`\`\`python # Asegúrate de importar las librerías necesarias al principio # Por ejemplo, si necesitas pandas, deberías tener: import pandas as pd class BiometricTableImporter: def __init__(self, file_path, sheet_name, usecols, skiprows, nrows): self.file_path = file_path self.sheet_name = sheet_name self.usecols = usecols self.skiprows = skiprows self.nrows = nrows def import_table(self): # Suponiendo que usas pandas para leer una hoja de Excel: df = pd.read_excel( self.file_path, sheet_name=self.sheet_name, usecols=self.usecols, skiprows=self.skiprows, nrows=self.nrows ) return df if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": file_path = r\\"F:1AssegurancesMUTUALITATSMANUAL2 NORMATIVA5.-Taules actuarials3bis.-Anexos Resolución de 17 de diciembre de 2020.xlsx\\" sheet_name = \\"Anexo 2.1\\" usecols = \\"C:E\\" skiprows = 8 nrows = 120 importer = BiometricTableImporter(file_path, sheet_name, usecols, skiprows, nrows) biometric_table = importer.import_table() print(biometric_table) # Simplemente para verificar la salida \`\`\` Recuerda instalar \`pandas\` si aún no lo has hecho, puedes hacerlo a través de la terminal de PyCharm con el comando: \`\`\`bash pip install pandas \`\`\` Si aún recibes errores, por favor proporciona toda la traza del error (\`traceback\`) y la parte específica del código donde ocurre, para poder seguir ayudándote de forma más específica."},{"instruction":"pycharm no entiende __name__","output":"PyCharm, como entorno de desarrollo integrado (IDE), debería reconocer \`__name__\` sin problemas, ya que es parte del estándar de Python. Si encuentras un error relacionado con \`__name__\`, esto podría ser indicativo de un problema en otra parte de tu código o una configuración incorrecta. Aquí hay varias cosas que debes verificar: 1. **Errores tipográficos**: Asegúrate de que no ha habido errores tipográficos al escribir \`__name__\`. Debe tener dos guiones bajos a cada lado del nombre y \`main\` también con dos guiones bajos alrededor. 2. **Configuración de PyCharm**: Verifica que PyCharm esté utilizando el intérprete de Python correcto. Ve a \`File\` > \`Settings\` > \`Project: TuProyecto\` > \`Python Interpreter\` y asegúrate de que el intérprete seleccionado sea el que tiene Python correctamente instalado. 3. **File Encoding**: Si estás copiando y pegando código de diferentes fuentes, a veces el encoding de caracteres puede causar errores inesperados. Verifica si hay caracteres invisibles o problemas de codificación de caracteres que puedan estar causando el error. 4. **Ejecución del Script Correcto**: Asegúrate de que PyCharm esté ejecutando el script que pretendes ejecutar. Puede que accidentalmente estés ejecutando un script diferente al que estás editando. 5. **Consistencia del Código**: Confirma que no haya caracteres invisibles o errores introducidos por espacios o tabulaciones inconsistentes. Python es muy estricto en cuanto a la indentación y la estructura del código. 6. **Revisión del Código Fuente**: Revisa si la sentencia \`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\` está fuera de cualquier clase o función y que está en el nivel superior de tu script. 7. **Reinstalar PyCharm**: Si todos los demás enfoques fallan y parece haber un problema con PyCharm, podrías considerar desinstalar y reinstalar PyCharm. 8. **Versiones de Python**: Confirma que la versión de Python que estás utilizando es compatible con el código que estás ejecutando. PyCharm debería trabajar bien con versiones de Python 2.7 y 3.x. Si después de estas revisiones sigues experimentando problemas, te recomendaría crear un nuevo archivo \`Python\` en PyCharm y escribir o copiar el código siguiente como una prueba mínima: \`\`\`python if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": print(\\"El script está ejecutándose como el programa principal\\") \`\`\` Si al ejecutar este código te muestra correctamente el mensaje en la consola, entonces \`__name__\` está siendo reconocido y el problema está en alguna otra parte del código que no se ha compartido aquí.

Además, si realizas sumatorios con datos que pueden tener \`NaN\` (no disponibles), \`pandas\` los manejará correctamente, pero debes ser consciente de que estén presentes, ya que podrían afectar tus resultados o requerir un manejo especial como reemplazarlos o eliminarlos."},{"instruction":"si con cada tabla que ya tengo en class quiero que genere diferentes variables haciendo cálculos para cada una, como lo hago?","output":"Si quieres generar diferentes variables que contengan cálculos basados en las tablas que ya tienes importadas en tu clase, puedes definir métodos adicionales para realizar estos cálculos. Cada método podría estar diseñado para operar en una tabla y generar las variables deseadas. A continuación, te muestro cómo podrías modificar la clase \`BiometricTableImporter\` para incluir métodos de cálculo que operen sobre las tablas importadas y retornen las variables calculadas: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd class BiometricTableImporter: def __init__(self, file_path): self.file_path = file_path def import_table(self, sheet_name, usecols, skiprows, nrows): df = pd.read_excel( self.file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name, usecols=usecols, skiprows=skiprows, nrows=nrows ) return df def calculate_something_from_table(self, df): # Supongamos que quieres calcular la suma de una columna total_sum = df['UnaColumna'].sum() return total_sum def calculate_another_thing_from_table(self, df): # Supongamos que quieres calcular el promedio de una columna average = df['OtraColumna'].mean() return average # Puedes agregar más métodos según sea necesario para hacer otros cálculos # Uso de la clase con los métodos de cálculo if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": file_path = \\"ruta/a/tu/archivo.xlsx\\" importer = BiometricTableImporter(file_path) # Parámetros para importar una tabla sheet_name = \\"NombreDeLaHoja\\" usecols = \\"A:D\\" skiprows = 3 nrows = 50 table = importer.import_table(sheet_name, usecols, skiprows, nrows) # Calcular algo a partir de la tabla importada total_sum = importer.calculate_something_from_table(table) print(\\"La suma de 'UnaColumna' es:\\", total_sum) # Calcular otra cosa de la misma tabla average = importer.calculate_another_thing_from_table(table) print(\\"El promedio de 'OtraColumna' es:\\", average) # Continúa con más cálculos si es necesario... \`\`\` En este ejemplo, he agregado dos métodos de cálculo, \`calculate_something_from_table\` y \`calculate_another_thing_from_table\`, para ilustrar cómo podrías realizar cálculos diferentes en la tabla importada. Cada uno de estos métodos toma como argumento un \`DataFrame\` (que es el resultado de importar una tabla) y realiza un cálculo específico para devolver un resultado. Esta estructura te permite separar el proceso de importación de datos del cálculo basado en esos datos, lo que es una buena práctica en términos de organización del código y separación de responsabilidades. Recuerda adaptar los nombres de los métodos y las operaciones a los cálculos específicos que necesitas hacer, así como los nombres de las columnas a los que se encuentran en tus tablas de Excel."},{"instruction":"si lo que quiero es que de las tablas leídas, que contienen qx, acaben teniendo más columnas con nuevas variables que calculo en python como lx, Mx, Nx...como lo hago?","output":"Para agregar nuevas columnas calculadas a los \`DataFrame\` que has importado desde las tablas de Excel, puedes definir funciones o métodos que realicen los cálculos a partir de los valores existentes y que luego asignen los resultados a nuevas columnas dentro de estos \`DataFrame\`. Estas columnas adicionales representarán tus nuevas variables calculadas (\`lx\`, \`Mx\`, \`Nx\`, etc.). A continuación, te presento un ejemplo básico de cómo podrías modificar tus \`DataFrame\` para agregar nuevas columnas calculadas a partir de los datos existentes: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Suponiendo que esta es la clase que importa los DataFrames class BiometricTableImporter: # ... definiciones anteriores de la clase # Método para agregar nuevas columnas calculadas (como lx, Mx, Nx) def add_calculated_columns(self, df): # Cálculo de 'lx' como ejemplo.

La columna \`lx\` se calcula directamente aplicando una función a la columna \`qx\` existente. La columna \`Mx\` se calcula iterativamente para obtener un valor acumulativo, lo que es común en tablas actuariales. La columna \`Nx\` hace algo similar, potencialmente en reversa si ese es el cálculo requerido. Es importante que adaptes las fórmulas y las iteraciones a los cálculos específicos que necesitas realizar. Si tus cálculos se basan en valores acumulativos o dependen de cálculos previos, como suele suceder en actuaría, asegúrate de que las funciones y las iteraciones estén estructuradas de manera que reflejen esas dependencias correctamente. Finalmente, ten presente que operaciones como iterar sobre un \`DataFrame\` con \`iterrows()\` pueden ser lentas para conjuntos de datos muy grandes, y existen técnicas más eficientes para realizar ciertos cálculos acumulativos, como usar métodos vectorizados o funciones integradas de pandas como \`cumsum()\` para sumas acumulativas. Ajusta el código para obtener el mejor rendimiento según tus necesidades particulares."},{"instruction":"como veo un repositorio su formulación en pycharm?","output":"Para ver y trabajar con un repositorio de Git en PyCharm, puedes seguir estos pasos: 1. **Clonar el Repositorio**: Si aún no has clonado el repositorio a tu máquina local, puedes hacerlo directamente desde PyCharm. - Ve a \`File\` > \`New\` > \`Project from Version Control\`. - En el cuadro que aparece, ingresa la URL del repositorio de Git que deseas clonar. - Elige la carpeta donde quieres guardar el proyecto localmente y pulsa \`Clone\`. 2. **Abrir un Proyecto Existente**: Si ya tienes el repositorio clonado en tu sistema: - Abre PyCharm. - Ve a \`File\` > \`Open\` y navega hasta la carpeta donde está el repositorio clonado. - Selecciona la carpeta y haz clic en \`OK\` para abrir el proyecto con su repositorio de Git. 3. **Visión General del Repositorio**: Una vez que tienes el proyecto abierto en PyCharm: - Puedes ver la herramienta de \`Version Control\` normalmente en la parte inferior de la ventana de PyCharm. Si no está visible, puedes activarla desde \`View\` > \`Tool Windows\` > \`Version Control\` o presionando \`Alt + 9\` (en Windows/Linux). - La herramienta \`Version Control\` te ofrece diversas pestañas como \`Log\`, \`Branches\`, y \`Console\`, donde puedes ver el historial de commits, administrar ramas y realizar operaciones de Git respectivamente. 4. **Explorar Commits y Cambios**: En la pestaña \`Log\` de la herramienta \`Version Control\`, podrás ver una lista de commits con su mensaje, autor y fecha. Puedes clicar en un commit para ver los cambios específicos que se realizaron en ese punto en el código. 5. **Administrar Ramas**: En la pestaña \`Branches\`, podrás ver todas las ramas del repositorio y cambiar entre ellas haciendo clic derecho y seleccionando \`Checkout\`. También puedes crear, eliminar y fusionar ramas desde aquí. 6. **Hacer Commits**: Para hacer cambios y confirmarlos (commit) al repositorio: - Haces las modificaciones en los archivos del proyecto. - Abres la herramienta \`Commit\` (\`Ctrl + K\` en Windows/Linux), donde puedes revisar tus cambios, escribir un mensaje de commit y confirmarlos presionando el botón \`Commit\` o \`Commit and Push\` si también deseas enviar los cambios al repositorio remoto. 7. **Actualizar Proyecto y Push/Pull**: Puedes actualizar tu proyecto local con los últimos cambios del repositorio remoto utilizando la función de \`Update Project\` (\`VCS\` > \`Update Project\` o \`Ctrl + T\`), y puedes hacer \`push\` para subir tus commits a remoto o \`pull\` para traer cambios desde el repositorio remoto. Todo esto asume que estás utilizando Git como tu sistema de control de versiones y que PyCharm tiene configurado correctamente el plugin de Git, que normalmente viene preinstalado y activado en PyCharm. Asegúrate también de tener configuradas tus credenciales de Git si el repositorio requiere autenticación. PyCharm facilita mucho la gestión de repositorios Git directamente desde la interfaz del IDE, permitiéndote llevar a cabo casi todas las operaciones de Git necesarias para el desarrollo cotidiano sin tener que recurrir a la línea de comandos."},{"instruction":"ver el código de un package en pycharm","output":"Para ver el código fuente de un paquete instalado (package) en PyCharm, puedes hacer lo siguiente: 1. **Navegar al Código del Paquete**: Simplemente haz clic derecho sobre el nombre de la librería o el paquete en tu código y selecciona \\"Go To\\" > \\"Declaration\\" o \\"Definition\\" desde el menú contextual. Esto generalmente te llevará al código fuente de la clase o función que estás utilizando. Puede ser que PyCharm te lleve a un archivo \`.pyi\` que es un archivo de stub que solo contiene las definiciones de tipos del paquete, pero también puede proporcionar un enlace para ir al código fuente si está disponible. 2. **Uso del Explorador de Proyectos**: Puedes encontrar el código fuente del paquete en la estructura del proyecto dentro de PyCharm. Generalmente, el código fuente de los paquetes que has instalado está en la carpeta de tu entorno virtual, bajo \`lib/site-packages\` (o \`Lib\` en Windows). En PyCharm: - Accede a la vista del \\"Project\\" en el lado izquierdo de la ventana del IDE. - Navega por la carpeta que corresponde a tu entorno virtual (hacia algo como \`.venv/lib/site-packages\` o \`.venvLibsite-packages\` en Windows). - Encuentra el nombre del paquete que te interesa y expande su carpeta para ver los archivos fuente de Python (\`.py\`). 3. **Buscar un Símbolo**: PyCharm ofrece una herramienta de búsqueda para saltar a cualquier clase, archivo o símbolo en tu proyecto, incluyendo símbolos de terceros (paquetes externos). Puedes usar \\"Navigate\\" > \\"Symbol…\\" o el atajo de teclado \`Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N\` (en Windows/Linux) y escribir el nombre del símbolo que estás buscando. 4. **Acceder Directamente a través del Código**: Si estás utilizando un paquete en tu código (por ejemplo, llamando a una función de ese paquete), puedes simplemente mantener presionada la tecla \`Ctrl\` y hacer clic en el nombre de la función o clase. Esto debería llevarte al código fuente. 5. **Con el Atajo de teclado**: También puedes usar el atajo de teclado \`Ctrl + B\` o \`Cmd + B\` en MacOS mientras el cursor está sobre el símbolo (por ejemplo, una clase o método) para ir a su declaración. Si el código fuente está disponible, PyCharm te llevará a él. Ten en cuenta que algunos paquetes pueden no tener su código fuente disponible directamente si contienen extensiones compiladas o si se distribuyen solo como archivos de rueda (wheel) sin fuentes. En esos casos, PyCharm podría mostrarte solo la interfaz de la API sin el código subyacente que está en archivos binarios o \`.pyc\`. Por último, también puedes buscar el código fuente del paquete en sitios como GitHub si está disponible de forma pública y no puedes acceder a él a través de PyCharm o si la librería está instalada de forma que PyCharm no pueda localizar el código fuente fácilmente."},{"instruction":"explicame paso a paso que hace este código: class MortalityTable: def __init__(self, lx=[], qx=[], i=[], nt=None, perc=100): self.lx = lx self.qx = qx self.dx = [] self.ex = [] self.w = 0 self.i = i self.q = 0 self.perc = perc self.nt = nt self.Dx = [] self.Nx = [] self.Cx = [] self.Mx = [] self.nEx = [] if nt: mt = nt init = mt[0] self.qx = [0.0] * init end_val = 0 for val in mt[1:]: if end_val < 1000.0: end_val = val * perc / 100 self.qx.append(end_val) if perc != 100: self.qx.append(1000) if self.lx == []: self.lx = [100000.0] for val in self.qx: self.lx.append(self.lx[-1] * (1 -

March 5, 2024 Authors Greg Brockman Ilya Sutskever John Schulman Sam Altman Wojciech Zaremba OpenAI Announcements The mission of OpenAI is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, which means both building safe and beneficial AGI and helping create broadly distributed benefits. We are now sharing what we've learned about achieving our mission, and some facts about our relationship with Elon. We intend to move to dismiss all of Elon’s claims. We realized building AGI will require far more resources than we’d initially imagined Elon said we should announce an initial 1B funding commitment to OpenAI. In total, the non-profit has raised less than 45M from Elon and more than 90M from other donors. When starting OpenAI in late 2015, Greg and Sam had initially planned to raise 100M. Elon said in an email: “We need to go with a much bigger number than 100M to avoid sounding hopeless… I think we should say that we are starting with a 1B funding commitment… I will cover whatever anyone else doesn't provide.” [1] We spent a lot of time trying to envision a plausible path to AGI. In early 2017, we came to the realization that building AGI will require vast quantities of compute. We began calculating how much compute an AGI might plausibly require. We all understood we were going to need a lot more capital to succeed at our mission—billions of dollars per year, which was far more than any of us, especially Elon, thought we’d be able to raise as the non-profit. We and Elon recognized a for-profit entity would be necessary to acquire those resources As we discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, Elon wanted us to merge with Tesla or he wanted full control. Elon left OpenAI, saying there needed to be a relevant competitor to Google/DeepMind and that he was going to do it himself. He said he’d be supportive of us finding our own path. In late 2017, we and Elon decided the next step for the mission was to create a for-profit entity. Elon wanted majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO. In the middle of these discussions, he withheld funding. Reid Hoffman bridged the gap to cover salaries and operations. We couldn’t agree to terms on a for-profit with Elon because we felt it was against the mission for any individual to have absolute control over OpenAI. He then suggested instead merging OpenAI into Tesla. In early February 2018, Elon forwarded us an email suggesting that OpenAI should “attach to Tesla as its cash cow”, commenting that it was “exactly right… Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn’t zero”. [2] Elon soon chose to leave OpenAI, saying that our probability of success was 0, and that he planned to build an AGI competitor within Tesla. When he left in late February 2018, he told our team he was supportive of us finding our own path to raising billions of dollars. In December 2018, Elon sent us an email saying “Even raising several hundred million won’t be enough. This needs billions per year immediately or forget it.” [3] We advance our mission by building widely-available beneficial tools We’re making our technology broadly usable in ways that empower people and improve their daily lives, including via open-source contributions. We provide broad access to today's most powerful AI, including a free version that hundreds of millions of people use every day. For example, Albania is using OpenAI’s tools to accelerate its EU accession by as much as 5.5 years; Digital Green is helping boost farmer income in Kenya and India by dropping the cost of agricultural extension services 100x by building on OpenAI; Lifespan, the largest healthcare provider in Rhode Island, uses GPT-4 to simplify its surgical consent forms from a college reading level to a 6th grade one; Iceland is using GPT-4 to preserve the Icelandic language. Elon understood the mission did not imply open-sourcing AGI. As Ilya told Elon: “As we get closer to building AI, it will make sense to start being less open. The Open in openAI means that everyone should benefit from the fruits of AI after its built, but it's totally OK to not share the science...”, to which Elon replied: “Yup”. [4] We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired—someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without him. We are focused on advancing our mission and have a long way to go. As we continue to make our tools better and better, we are excited to deploy these systems so they empower every individual. Update March 11, 2024: We are seeking to have the lawsuit assigned to dedicated case management, since it involves AI technology and the claims span almost a decade. [1] From: Elon Musk <> To: Greg Brockman <> CC: Sam Altman <> Date: Sun, Nov 22, 2015 at 7:48 PM Subject: follow up from call Blog sounds good, assuming adjustments for neutrality vs being YC-centric. I'd favor positioning the blog to appeal a bit more to the general public -- there is a lot of value to having the public root for us to succeed -- and then having a longer, more detailed and inside-baseball version for recruiting, with a link to it at the end of the general public version. We need to go with a much bigger number than 100M to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending. I think we should say that we are starting with a 1B funding commitment. This is real. I will cover whatever anyone else doesn't provide. Template seems fine, apart from shifting to a vesting cash bonus as default, which can optionally be turned into YC or potentially SpaceX (need to understand how much this will be) stock.

We may wish it otherwise, but, in my and ’s opinion, Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn't zero. Begin forwarded message: From: <> To: Elon Musk <> Date: January 31, 2018 at 11:54:30 PM PST Subject: Re: Top AI institutions today Working at the cutting edge of AI is unfortunately expensive. For example,In addition to DeepMind, Google also has Google Brain, Research, and Cloud. And TensorFlow, TPUs, and they own about a third of all research (in fact, they hold their own AI conferences). I also strongly suspect that compute horsepower will be necessary (and possibly even sufficient) to reach AGI. If historical trends are any indication, progress in AI is primarily driven by systems - compute, data, infrastructure. The core algorithms we use today have remained largely unchanged from the ~90s. Not only that, but any algorithmic advances published in a paper somewhere can be almost immediately re-implemented and incorporated. Conversely, algorithmic advances alone are inert without the scale to also make them scary. It seems to me that OpenAI today is burning cash and that the funding model cannot reach the scale to seriously compete with Google (an 800B company). If you can't seriously compete but continue to do research in open, you might in fact be making things worse and helping them out “for free”, because any advances are fairly easy for them to copy and immediately incorporate, at scale. A for-profit pivot might create a more sustainable revenue stream over time and would, with the current team, likely bring in a lot of investment. However, building out a product from scratch would steal focus from AI research, it would take a long time and it's unclear if a company could “catch up” to Google scale, and the investors might exert too much pressure in the wrong directions.The most promising option I can think of, as I mentioned earlier, would be for OpenAI to attach to Tesla as its cash cow. I believe attachments to other large suspects (e.g. Apple? Amazon?) would fail due to an incompatible company DNA. Using a rocket analogy, Tesla already built the “first stage” of the rocket with the whole supply chain of Model 3 and its onboard computer and a persistent internet connection. The “second stage” would be a full self driving solution based on large-scale neural network training, which OpenAI expertise could significantly help accelerate. With a functioning full self-driving solution in ~2-3 years we could sell a lot of cars/trucks. If we do this really well, the transportation industry is large enough that we could increase Tesla's market cap to high O(~100K), and use that revenue to fund the AI work at the appropriate scale. I cannot see anything else that has the potential to reach sustainable Google-scale capital within a decade. [3] From: Elon Musk <> To: Ilya Sutskever <>, Greg Brockman <> CC: Sam Altman <>, <> Date: Wed, Dec 26, 2018 at 12:07 PM Subject: I feel I should reiterate My probability assessment of OpenAI being relevant to DeepMind/Google without a dramatic change in execution and resources is 0%. Not 1%. I wish it were otherwise. Even raising several hundred million won't be enough. This needs billions per year immediately or forget it. Unfortunately, humanity's future is in the hands of . And they are doing a lot more than this. I really hope I'm wrong.

Congratulations on landing the Falcon 9, what an amazing achievement. Time to build out the fleet now! I've seen you (and Sam and other OpenAI people) doing a lot of interviews recently extolling the virtues of open sourcing AI, but I presume you realise that this is not some sort of panacea that will somehow magically solve the safety problem? There are many good arguments as to why the approach you are taking is actually very dangerous and in fact may increase the risk to the world. Some of the more obvious points are well articulated in this blog post, that I'm sure you've seen, but there are also other important considerations: http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/17/should-ai-be-open/ I’d be interested to hear your counter-arguments to these points.

As we get closer to building AI, it will make sense to start being less open. The Open in openAI means that everyone should benefit from the fruits of AI after its built, but it's totally OK to not share the science (even though sharing everything is definitely the right strategy in the short and possibly medium term for recruitment purposes).

They started with the goal to make powerful AI (called AGI) to help everyone, but it was more expensive than they thought. Elon Musk told them to say they had a lot more money, a billion dollars, to make OpenAI sound good and strong. Elon Musk was a part of OpenAI at the start, but he wanted too much control and to mix OpenAI with his company Tesla or be the main boss. When they were trying to figure out how to get more money, Elon stopped giving them money for a while. A person named Reid Hoffman helped them pay for things then. The people at OpenAI didn't want one person, like Elon, to have all the power, because it went against their idea of AI for everyone. So, Elon decided to leave OpenAI and said he'd make his own AI at Tesla. He even sued OpenAI when they started doing well without him. Now, OpenAI says they are making AI tools that lots of people can use and benefit from, and they didn't need to share how they made the AI because the important thing was that the AI would help people in the end. They're sad about fighting with Elon because he once inspired them, but then said they would fail and started his own AI projects. OpenAI will keep working on their mission. They also mentioned they're dealing with Elon's lawsuit in a way that focuses on AI technology because his claims cover a long time."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
