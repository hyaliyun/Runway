You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: What is great art? On the one hand, we can all see that great art is old art which is called great. But how do we know which art of our own times is great, and which will be forgotten? And who decides? These are important questions, for the great art of the past often was not considered great during its own time. When Shakespeare and Charles Dickens were writing, for example, most critics considered them as hack   writers with little or no literary ability. Similarly, Van Gogh and many of the other Impressionist painters of the late nineteenth century were not allowed to participate in events involving what were thought to be the \\"real\\" painters of the time, and often they were very poor. Yet today their paintings often sell for millions of dollars, while those so-called \\"real\\" painters are now barely remembered. So what makes great art? Can, for example, rock music be great art? Music videos? Cartoons and comics? Those who call themselves critics of the fine arts often have been the last to recognize great art in the past, and we can probably expect this to be the situation today. Critics often don't recognize great art because they tend to be prejudiced against what is popular. Popular works, whether they are novels, movies, or comics, are usually considered to be produced for the sake of money only, and not for the sake of art. But popularity, it seems to me, is one of the three signs that a present-day work of art may come to be thought of as great. The other two are that it is groundbreaking, and that it is inherently   beautiful. Many works have one or even two of these qualities of being popular, unusual, and beautiful. But having all the three often will mean that a work of art will someday be seen to be great, though it may take a good spoonful of time, such as a century or two, to know for sure. What can be inferred from the passage? A) Critics have changed their attitudes to great works. B) Most of the opinions of critics are valueless. C) The work of art itself, not the critics, determines its greatness. D) Works of Impressionist painters will be great one day. The answer is:","output":"C) The work of art itself, not the critics, determines its greatness. The passage highlights that great art is often not recognized during its own time, using examples of Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Van Gogh, and Impressionist painters. It emphasizes that critics have been the last to recognize great art in the past, primarily because they tend to be prejudiced against popular works. However, the text also acknowledges that popularity, being groundbreaking, and inherent beauty are the three signs that a present-day work of art may come to be thought of as great. While it is true that some critics' opinions may be valueless (B), the passage does not explicitly infer that most of their opinions are so. It does imply, though, that critics do not always recognize greatness in art primarily due to their biases. The passage does not discuss the change in critics' attitudes (A) or the future greatness of Impressionist painters specifically (D). Instead, it emphasizes that the work of art itself ultimately determines its greatness, and time often acts as a revealing factor."},{"instruction":"If I tell you that Exercise can teach animals how to behave, and ask you the question \\"what can teach animals how to behave?\\", is the correct answer \\"adding heat\\"?","output":"No, the correct answer would be \\"exercise\\" based on the information you provided."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Converge Magazine recently published articles about mistakes students should make. It suggests students need to live a balanced life, even in the college environment. According to the topic of the article, there are four mistakes students should make. The mistakes include: Think they pick the wrong major   A student should explore any possibility that interests him, and future careers might just be around the corner. Remember, if you don't know what to do, it's OK! Think their teachers know everything Students may think of their teachers as gods who know everything, but that really is not the case. Students should know teachers are the ones who can help us understand better. Students can research answers on their own and get their own opinions instead of having their teachers tell them the answers. Think they get too involved Getting good grades is very important, but it's only a part of the life. Joining clubs and learning about social situations are all good for teenagers' growth. It will not only make the students more knowledgeable but also create interest in their education. Think taking a day off is a waste of time Now, students are under too much pressure. It's necessary for them to relax now and then. But they always keep in mind how that might influence their schoolwork. Take a day off to relax, and you may get an energetic student the next day. Just don't do it too often. The writer thinks that   _  . A) students should pick the right major B) getting grades is all for students C) relaxing at times is necessary for students D) teachers shouldn't make mistakes The answer is:","output":"C) relaxing at times is necessary for students. To justify this answer, let's go through the question and the given mistakes step-by-step. 1. Think they pick the wrong major: The writer suggests that exploring possibilities and being open to change is important for students. This point supports personal growth, not a specific focus on picking the right major. 2. Think their teachers know everything: This point encourages students to research their own answers and develop their own opinions instead of relying solely on teachers. It doesn't suggest teachers shouldn't make mistakes; rather, it acknowledges teachers don't know everything. 3. Think they get too involved: The writer advocates for a balanced life, incorporating both academics and extracurricular activities. This doesn't imply that getting grades is all for the students. 4. Think taking a day off is a waste of time: Here, the writer emphasizes the importance of relaxation and self-care, recommending occasional days off for rejuvenation. This directly supports the answer that relaxing at times is necessary for students. Thus, based on the topic of the article and the given mistakes, option C) relaxing at times is necessary for students aligns with the intended message."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The issue hit the headlines again this week, with Football Association chairman Greg Dyke demanding changes in top-flight clubs' squads to ensure young English players get more game time. However, behind the scenes 29 clubs from across the Premier League and Championship - those which operate England's top-rated youth academies - are looking at innovative ways to help turn the best youngsters into the stars of tomorrow. Over the past year a number of data-based initiatives have been introduced in these academies to ensure youngsters are not needlessly discarded before realising their full potential. At present in the top clubs, just 0.5% of Under-9 players get all the way through the ranks to the same club's first eleven - a 1-in-200 chance. \\"Football is an industry that has been running for hundreds of years, with hundreds of thousands of players developed,\\" says James Bunce, the Premier League's head of sport science. \\"But as an industry we don't know what it takes to become a professional player, or international player.  It is pretty much a black hole, but we are starting to fill that void now. \\"The clubs are working hard, pushing forward.\\" A major part of this new data approach includes making sure players are not overlooked because of the month they were born - those born in a certain part of the year can be less physically developed than others. Clubs are sharing information on growth and maturation, and on physical testing, so that accurate benchmarks can be established, and players are assessed not just on their chronological age but also on their biological development. Mr Bunce says the main goal is for clubs to produce their own players for the first team. However, if a player does not make the Premier League grade, Mr Bunce says the effort will not have been wasted if the player reaches his maximum potential and goes on to a career in the Championship, League One or League Two. He also said that the aim was not to \\"battery farm\\" home-grown players to sell on for profit, but that developing their own good young players could help clubs become more profitable. Mr Bunce has been at the Premier League for 12 months, after eight years as head of athletic development at Southampton, a club known in recent years for developing a clear path for young talent into the first team. One of the issues the Premier League has to address is the bias at academy level towards players born in the September-to-November quarter of the calendar year, a phenomenon known in sport as the \\"relative age effect\\". This is a phenomenon associated with the cut-off dates for age group competition. The age group into which each Premier League academy player is placed is determined by his age on 31 August. It means children born in September will have a physical advantage over those born in August, because they will have had nearly a whole extra year to grow and develop. Yet the two will be in the same football team. In the Premier League academies it means that player recruitment is heavily skewed towards those born in the September-to-November period - accounting for some 45% of the intake - whereas those born in the June-to-August quarter provide just 10% of the young players. There is a similar trend with regard to Premier League players, with \\"summer born\\" players least represented in teams, but the imbalance is not as dramatically pronounced as at academy level. Mr Bunce says the discrepancy is not down to the UK birth-rate, as there is a fairly equal distribution of babies being born across the calendar year. \\"And in the England national team squad there is an equal distribution of players across the four quarters [of the year], which suggests that at elite level the \\"relative age effect\\" does not occur. \\"We're now looking at what it takes to become a Premier League player irrespective of when you were born in the year. We are looking to identify talent that might not be properly developed at present, to make sure it goes through the academy system.\\" To help in that ambition, the 29 clubs are sharing data about their youngsters - although the players remain anonymous when data is forwarded for collation. A major part of this is the young player growth and maturation project, with 140 staff at the clubs taught how to take players' growth measurements accurately. In addition the Premier League has provided standardised physical testing equipment to clubs, to again ensure uniformity in the way the data is collected. All this should enable clubs to compare the physical progress of an individual player accurately, against a benchmark of their peers, while also taking into consideration the period of the year in which the youngster was born. \\"It enables clubs to tell if a player is an early, late, or on-time developer,\\" says Mr Bunce, who was speaking at a Sports Analytics summit in London organised by Innovation Enterprise. \\"A player who looks slow can still develop, and may just need more time. And the fastest player might actually be behind on his developmental trajectory.\\" One aim of the data harvesting is to ultimately allow the Premier League and clubs in future to be able to group boys based on their physical maturity rather than age groups. This could lead to tournaments where boys are put in teams based on maturation level rather than age. Meanwhile, a Premier League injury surveillance programme has been established, with expert Dr Colin Fuller, who headed up major injury data projects in rugby union, brought in. \\"We know that 100% of players will get injured at some point, whether it be a severe injury or a one-day one,\\" says Mr Bunce.  \\"We don't know if there are any traits, and that is something we want to know more about. It is about how we can use data to build knowledge to prevent injuries.\\" Looking ahead, in future the Premier League would also like to add two further data projects - one around psychology and one for technical skills. \\"We understand that the psychological aspect is an intensely important element in sport, but would like to know more,\\" says Mr Bunce. On the technical skills criteria, the Premier League has held discussions with the heads of coaching at clubs \\"so that we can work together to establish technical benchmarks for our young players\\". Summary:","output":"Top Premier League and Championship football clubs are using innovative data initiatives in their youth academies to develop young talent and help ensure promising players aren't discarded due to age or physical development disparities, addressing the \\"relative age effect\\" bias."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now faces a lifetime of anti-cancer drugs to keep the tumour at bay. Doctors say chances of cancer returning after mastectomy are very rare. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Brave Survivor Faces Breast Cancer Recurrence After Mastectomy: An Unusual Case Several years ago, Maureen Hanlan, a now 71-year-old woman, underwent a double mastectomy to remove breast cancer. She lived with the belief that breast cancer was a chapter in her life she had closed forever. However, Maureen was shocked to learn recently that her cancer has returned despite the life-altering surgery she underwent years ago. This rare occurrence has left many wondering how the cancer could resurface after a mastectomy and the implications for women who have experienced similar procedures. Almost a decade ago, in a bid to stop the progression of breast cancer, Maureen made the difficult choice to have both her breasts removed. With the double mastectomy deemed successful, she believed her chances of getting breast cancer again were all but gone. However, nine years after the procedure, her world was turned upside down when she developed a bumpy rash on her chest, prompting her medical team to order a biopsy. When the tests came back, Maureen was devastated to learn that her breast cancer had re-emerged. Despite the double mastectomy, her aggressive foe had made a comeback, leaving her grappling with the grim reality that she would need to face the terror of breast cancer once more. Now, Maureen must undergo a lifetime of anti-cancer drugs with the hopes of keeping the recurring tumor at bay. This long-term treatment is bound to be taxing, both physically and emotionally. Regardless, she remains determined to stand strong and face the challenges ahead. The rare phenomenon of cancer returning after a mastectomy raises several important questions and concerns. For women who have had mastectomies, they may be rightfully worried if their battle against breast cancer is truly over. While Maureen's case is unusual, it underscores the unpredictable nature of cancer and the significance of ongoing care and maintenance. According to medical professionals, the likelihood of cancer re-emerging after a mastectomy is incredibly rare. Nevertheless, it is essential for women who have undergone such procedures to maintain regular check-ups and vigilance, monitoring any changes in their bodies that could be indicative of a recurrence. Maureen's ordeal serves as a reminder that the battle against breast cancer is often fraught with setbacks and surprises. Even in the face of such adversity, her resilience and determination are genuinely admirable. Her journey can serve as an example to others dealing with similar challenges and strengthen the resolve to never underestimate the power of hope and determination. In conclusion, Maureen Hanlan's experience with breast cancer recurrence following a double mastectomy highlights the need for continued care, vigilance, and awareness for women who have undergone similar surgeries. Though the chances are slim, it is crucial to recognize that the fight against breast cancer is a lifelong one, requiring diligence and strength even in the wake of apparent victory. Let her battle be a beacon of hope and resilience for others fighting their own battles against this terrible disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage. You must determine whether or not the question is answerable from the given passage. If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Q: Passage: The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and accelerating economic and political integration. Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \\"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\\" (or for the General Court, the \\"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is to \\"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission. Question: What is the main judicial body of the EU? A:","output":"Explanation of the task: The passage provided discusses the judicial branch of the EU and its roles. The task requires determining if the question \\"What is the main judicial body of the EU?\\" can be answered using the information given in the passage. Task Guidelines: Only use information from the passage to answer the question. No external information should be considered. If the question is answerable, the output should be 'True'. If it's unanswerable, the output should be 'False'. Solving the task: From the passage: \\"Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body...\\" So, the question \\"What is the main judicial body of the EU?\\" can be answered using the passage.

Context: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... Question: Why did narrator had plenty of time?

Here, \\"calmed down\\" refers to a decrease in the intensity of an emotional state, such as anger, fear, or agitation. \\"Suddenly\\" has the same meaning as in Sentence 1, indicating that the transition was fast and possibly unforeseen. Based on these definitions, we can determine that both sentences describe Tuppence undergoing a transformative emotional experience, leading to a less intense state.

A Yazoo City man is being detained by the Humphreys County Sheriff's Department after two people reported being pulled over by someone who did not appear to be a law enforcement officer.      A Mercury Grand Marquis with blue lights, some of them painted blue, and glued on antennas is now in the hands of investigators.      They believe it could be the same vehicle involved in a police impersonation investigation that began about 9 p.m. on Wednesday.      Officers say a man saw blue lights flashing behind him and pulled over on Highway 149, near Silver City.      \\"Once he pulled over, he saw the suspect get out of the car and come to the passenger side of the vehicle, like he had his weapon out. So, immediately he saw that and took off,\\" says Yazoo County Sheriff Jacob Sheriff.      The impersonator gave chase but the motorist fought back.      \\"As they was going down the road where he speeded up to probably 120 miles per hour, he (the victim) stated, and fired a round out of the car.\\"      A short time later, a female also reported being pulled over in the same area by a similar car.      Thursday morning, Yazoo County deputies were able to stop the car, driven James Lucas, 45. They identified it by an upside down state of Mississippi tag on the front.      It matched the same description given by Humphreys County investigators. Humphreys County wouldn't say if Lucas is the person being questioned in the investigation, but deputies think the correct suspect is in custody.      \\"We are doing the investigation with M.B.I. to continue this, to see if he is our man, to make sure that we have the right guy,\\" explains Humphreys County Investigator Sam Dobbins.      According Yazoo County Sheriff Jacob Sheriff, a search of Lucas' girlfriend's Yazoo City home revealed fake handguns, police badges, and handcuffs.      Lucus was at one time a suspect in two separate investigations of impersonating a police officer.      If you're pulled over by an unmarked vehicle and don't feel safe, officers have some advice.      \\"Continue to a safe place and dial 911 or *MHP and continue to a safe place where they are comfortable in identifying them as being a law enforcement officer,\\" says Sheriff.      Investigators believe the Grand Marquis is a retired patrol car and was bought at an auction.      It's unclear if a second person was involved in the Humphreys County investigation.      Deputies are also trying to determine if this police impersonation investigation is tied to two deadly police impersonation shootings in north Mississippi.      Copyright 2012 WLBT.

What is a confidence interval in layman's terms? OPTIONS:  A). no  B). yes","output":"A). No These questions do not have the same meaning. Let's break down each question separately and see what they are asking. 1. How can I correlate two confidence intervals? This question is asking about the relationship between two confidence intervals and how they can be connected or correlated. In statistics, a confidence interval is a range that includes the true population parameter with a specified level of certainty. When comparing two confidence intervals, you might be interested in understanding if they share a common range or if they indicate a significant difference between the estimates of two population parameters. To correlate two confidence intervals, you should start by understanding the context of the data and the study. Then, you can compare the confidence intervals visually (via a data visualization such as a graph) or by checking if the intervals overlap or not. If the confidence intervals do not overlap, this can indicate a significant difference between the two estimates. However, if they do overlap, it suggests little evidence for a significant difference between the two population parameters being compared. 2. What is a confidence interval in layman's terms? This question is asking for a simple explanation of the term 'confidence interval,' an important concept in statistics. A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from a data sample, that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. The interval has an associated confidence level (usually expressed as a percentage, such as 95%) that quantifies the level of confidence that the true population parameter lies in the proposed range. In layman's terms, a confidence interval is like a \\"best guess\\" range for the true value of an unknown quantity (such as an average, proportion, or difference) in a population. The confidence level tells us how sure we can be about the estimation, with a higher level indicating more certainty. In summary, the two questions are asking different things. The first question is about the steps or methods involved in correlating two confidence intervals, while the second question requests a simple explanation of the concept of a confidence interval. Thus, the appropriate answer is: A). No"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Body language is quiet, secret and most powerful language of all. It speaks louder than words. According to specialists, our bodies send out more messages than we realize. In fact, non-verbal  communication takes up about fifty percent of what we usually mean. And body language is especially important, when we try to communicate across cultures. Indeed, what is called body language is so much a part of us that it's actually often unnoticed. And misunderstandings happen as a result of it. For example, different cultures treat the distance between people differently. Northern Europeans usually do not like having bodily contact ,even with friends. And certainly not with strangers. People from the Latin American countries, on the other hand, touch each other quite a lot. So it's possible that in conversation it may look like a Latino is following a Norwegian  all over the room. The Latino, trying to express friendship, will keep moving closer. The Norwegian, very probably seeing _ as rude behavior, will keep backing away, which the Latino will in return regarded as coldness. Obviously, a great deal is going on when people talk. And only a part of it is in the words themselves. And when parties are from different cultures, there's a strong possibility of misunderstanding. But whatever the situation is, the best advice is to obey the golden rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated. Question: If a foreign friend gives a hug to you, you should  _  .

The dramatic footage showcases their seven-minute struggle as they navigated the flooded terrain and treacherous conditions. According to KTLA, the couple were halfway up the 1,500-foot climb to Angels Landing lookout when the rain started to pour. Realizing the imminent threat, Birnbaum can be heard in the video exclaiming, \\"Oh my God. We need to get down,\\" while warning other hikers, \\"Guys, we need to go down, it's going to flood.\\" What followed was a grueling descent as they traversed flooded trails while being battered by 50mph winds, CBS Los Angeles reports. Further adding to their ordeal, KPHO reports hail the size of marbles raining down on them. In an interview with CBS, Birnbaum recalls their sole thought during the chaotic ordeal: survival. \\"It was just, 'We're going to get down this mountain,'\\" he says. During those life-threatening moments, it became apparent that the severity of the situation was not to be taken lightly, and survival instincts were crucial in determining their fate. Fortunately, Birnbaum and his girlfriend successfully made it to safety, but not all hikers that day were as fortunate. A tragic report from KTLA states that a group of seven hikers were killed due to the flash flood caused by more than half an inch of rain falling on the park in just one hour. This devastating event emphasizes the sheer unpredictability and force of flash floods. \\"These things are fast, they are deadly, and they can strike anywhere,\\" Birnbaum says, as reported by KPHO. The seven hikers who perished in the flooding had posed for a group photo shortly before the tragedy, unaware of the looming danger. This serves as a stark reminder of the importance of being vigilant and prepared for sudden weather changes, especially when taking part in outdoor activities. Although no one could have predicted the severity of the situation that Birnbaum and others faced that fateful day, the video captured on the GoPro will undoubtedly serve as a striking account of the power of nature and the importance of prioritizing safety when embarking on outdoor adventures. In conclusion, the harrowing footage captured by Birnbaum's GoPro provides viewers with a first-hand account of the couple's escape from the deadly flash flood in Zion National Park. As a cautionary tale, the video emphasizes the need for preparation, safety, and awareness when venturing into the outdoors. Additionally, it serves as a lasting reminder of the unpredictable aspects of nature and the potentially devastating consequences that can often arise without warning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  In which case the reactants concentration would decrease, case A or case B? Answer:","output":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. Therefore, the reactants concentration would decrease in case A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

She had just moved into the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to meet me. I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother,scared to look at each other. Soon we lost the shyness and started playing with each other. In the 7th grade ,I first lost touch with her. She was going through family problems and I _ her to be with the cooler people. None of my new friends liked her as much as I did because they knew she had problems. However, every summer we would always sit at each other's house, watch soap operas and talk about all the boys we like. It was last year when I noticed the problem. I guess I was too doveted in high school to realizeshe needed someone there. Anyway ,she made a new best friend and so did I. Then I didn't know why, but she started cutting herself! She then was diagnosed with clinical depression .At first, I was very upset, but we still stayed in touch. I wanted to be there with new her best friend basically deserted her and people were calling her crazy. Yesterday she came to me and said,\\"I never knew what a best friend was until you, the only person, would stop me cutting. I appreciate your help so much, and you didn't even know you were helping me.\\" We both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is never to give up on your friends.

Choices:  - kitchen floor - furniture - house - mobile home - own land  The rationale to choose \\"mobile home\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is \\"mobile home\\" because mobile homes often have these characteristics due to their design and cost-effective material usage. The rationale behind choosing \\"mobile home\\" consists of the following reasons: 1. Architectural design: Mobile homes, also known as manufactured homes or trailers, are specifically designed with practicality and affordability in mind. As a result, their architectural design often entails straightforward, boxy rooms or sections that are easily assembled at the manufacturing site and then transported to their final location. The more simplistic design allows for efficient use of space and cost savings during the construction process. 2. Material usage: To keep costs low, mobile homes are generally built with cost-effective materials, such as linoleum and less expensive wood products. Linoleum, in particular, is a common choice for flooring in mobile homes because it is not only budget-friendly, but also lightweight and easy to maintain. This makes it an ideal choice considering the sometimes limited weight capacity found in mobile homes. 3. Limited space and functionality: Mobile homes are generally smaller than traditional houses, which means their rooms need to be designed in a more space-saving and functional manner. Boxy rooms with simple angles may be more quickly and easily built, allowing manufacturers to save on costs and make the most of the available square footage. Thus, these rooms are cost-effective not only in terms of construction but also in the long run by requiring less energy for heating or cooling. 4. Comparison to other options: When examining the other choices given, \\"mobile home\\" becomes the most fitting answer. Kitchen floors and furniture are individual components of living spaces, not living spaces themselves. While it is true that some kitchens may have cheap linoleum coverings and some pieces of furniture can have boxy designs, these options do not provide a complete living environment. Similarly, a house built on one's own land could certainly have cheap linoleum coverings and boxy rooms, but this description is not exclusive to traditional houses and does not differentiate it from mobile homes. Taking all these factors into account, a mobile home is the most appropriate answer for a living situation characterized by a cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms. Mobile homes are designed with affordability, practicality, and efficient use of space in mind, making them the most suitable option among the choices provided."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Mei Qiyue, 13, of Chongqing, leaves her dorm  early every morning and doesn't return until late at night.

This hearty and abundant meal is not only known for its rich and unique flavors, but also as a representation of the country's diverse culinary traditions. As a scrumptious ensemble of various ingredients that create a harmonious blend of flavors, Bandeja paisa has etched its name in the annals of Colombian cuisine. At the heart of the Bandeja paisa lies a range of main ingredients: red beans, pork belly, white rice, ground meat, chicharon (fried pork rinds), fried egg, plantain (patacones), chorizo (a type of pork sausage), arepa (a maize-based flatbread), hogao sauce, black pudding (morcilla), avocado, and lemon. This amalgamation of components might be overwhelming at first glance, but when combined, they form an intricate and flavorful taste experience. The core of the dish comprises red beans, which are boiled and simmered to create a thick, velvety base with a hint of spice. To enhance the beans' flavor, they are often cooked in a broth that includes pork belly, which infuses the beans with a rich, savory depth. Accompanying the beans is a serving of fluffy white rice, which adds a simple yet comforting texture to the mix. Next, the ground meat and chicharon offer a more solid protein to the dish, while also introducing a wide array of succulent flavors. The deliciously crispy patacones (double-fried green plantains) bring a satisfying crunch to the plate, perfectly contrasting with the tender consistency of the other elements. Adding to this delightful assortment is a vibrant chorizo sausage - its robust paprika-infused taste infuses the palate with a hint of smokiness. By contrast, the arepa – a staple Colombian side – serves as a mild, pleasantly chewy component that complements the more intense flavors in the dish. The pièce de résistance is the hogao sauce, a Colombian classic made from tomatoes, onions, garlic, and cumin – its tangy and mildly spiced essence drizzles over the plate and unifies the diverse ingredients. On the other hand, the black pudding – or morcilla – crafted from pork blood and an assortment of spices introduces an unusual but delectable taste. The platter is rounded off with slices of creamy avocado, serving as a cool and buttery respite that balances and ties the flavors together. A touch of lemon juice sprinkled over the dish imparts a zesty freshness, perfectly encapsulating the essence of Colombian cuisine. In conclusion, Bandeja paisa represents the rich culinary tapestry of the Antioquia Department, Colombia, and invites food lovers to embark on a gastronomic adventure. Its multidimensional taste profile, featuring a tantalizing blend of flavors and textures, stands as a symbol of Colombia's diverse cuisine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Lancashire Firefighters Battle Moorland Blaze at Winter Hill for Over Five Hours Introduction In a show of perseverance, determination, and skill, firefighters in Lancashire have successfully managed to extinguish a moorland fire on Winter Hill that raged for more than five hours. The fire, which threatened to cause significant damage to the local ecosystem, was fought using a combination of specialized equipment, local knowledge, and teamwork. The Incident at Winter Hill Winter Hill, located in Lancashire, UK, is known for its beautiful views, hiking trails and diverse wildlife. Recently, this picturesque landscape was disrupted by a fire that spread through the moorland, causing considerable concern for both surrounding communities and conservationists.  The Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service were alerted to the fire on a Sunday afternoon, and immediately dispatched multiple fire engines and specialist wildfire units to the site. Firefighters from nearby stations, including those from Blackburn, Hyndburn, and Darwen, all joined forces to tackle the spreading flames. The Battle against the Fire Upon arrival, the emergency services found themselves facing a challenging battle to tame the flames. The dense, dry vegetation on the moor, combined with the powerful winds sweeping across the landscape, served to fuel the fire and hamper the firefighters' efforts.  However, these challenges were met head-on. It took the combined efforts of over 50 firefighters, working in harsh and testing conditions, to bring the flames under control. The firefighters relied on their extensive experience, training, and local knowledge of the area to strategically place themselves and their equipment which was crucial to combating the fire. In addition to the wildfires team's specialized vehicles and equipment, the firefighters also employed a technique called \\"beatering.\\" This method involves using large, heavy mats made from material such as canvas or hessian to smother and extinguish the fire by cutting off its oxygen supply. Beatering proved to be particularly effective on the moorland, as it allowed the firefighters to quickly control smaller fires that might otherwise have spread rapidly through the vegetation. Furthermore, the crews received assistance from above, with a helicopter attending the scene to provide aerial surveillance and support. This aerial perspective was invaluable in tracking the spread of the fire and directing the efforts of the ground crews. The Aftermath and Prevention After more than five hours of grueling work and unwavering dedication, the firefighters were ultimately successful in extinguishing the blaze, preventing it from spreading any further and causing potential irreparable damage to the fragile moorland environment. While the precise cause of the fire remains under investigation, it serves as a stark reminder of the potential danger posed by wildfires in moorland areas, particularly during the dry summer months. However, this incident demonstrates the impressive skill, expertise, and sheer determination of our emergency services. To help prevent similar incidents, the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service encourages the public to be vigilant and act responsibly when visiting moorlands, such as properly disposing of cigarette butts and not lighting fires or barbecues during times of elevated wildfire risk. Conclusion The efforts of the firefighters tackling the Winter Hill blaze are commendable, and it is thanks to their courage, determination, and teamwork that this fire was ultimately extinguished. The fire serves as a reminder of the importance of proactive fire prevention measures and responsible outdoor behavior. The public should prioritize preserving the natural beauty of our moorlands and ensuring the safety of their communities by adhering to guidelines and respecting the environment."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008. The answer to this question is:","output":"Johnston.

Her friend, a contractor who was doing work on the house, was also taken to the hospital; his condition was not disclosed.      Ms. Badger’s parents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, who died in the fire, were to celebrate their 49th anniversary on Monday, according to a family member, who asked not to be named.      Photo      Mr. Johnson, 71, spent his last day working at his dream job: as Santa Claus on the ninth floor of the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store in Manhattan, the family member said. He was known for his real long, white beard.      “That’s all he ever wanted to be,” the family member said. “He stopped shaving the day he retired.”      Mr. Johnson had spent decades as safety director for the Brown-Forman Corporation, the parent company of Jack Daniels, working on, among other things, fire code for distilleries, according to the family member.      Known professionally as “Happy Santa,” he advertised his act through Gigmasters.com, but initially found work only in a Connecticut mall. But the jobs proved rife with anecdotes. Once, when a cashier was late to work, and a line of disappointed children were told they would have to wait an hour or more for their photo with Santa, Mr. Johnson took it upon himself to open the gate and declare that pictures that morning would be free — as long as visitors had their own cameras.      This year, he successfully auditioned to be Saks’s Santa, and on Christmas Eve he worked there, giving out candy canes and posing for photos, while his wife watched and updated the family on the phone about the scene, the family member said. Ms. Johnson, 69, was a retired electrical contractor who had owned John Waters Inc., a heating and cooling company in Louisville, Ky., which she purchased almost 30 years ago, unusual for a woman in that region at that time.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Five years ago, they moved to the New York area to be near their grandchildren.      Property records show that Ms. Badger bought the three-story, 19th-century house in December 2010 for 1.725 million. The property is surrounded by other old and large houses in an affluent neighborhood of Stamford, 35 miles northeast of Midtown Manhattan. The house, neighbors and officials said, had been undergoing renovations in the past six months.      “It did not appear that the renovations were part of the cause; they might have been part of the spread,” Timothy Conroy, deputy fire chief, said in a telephone interview, adding that the cause was under investigation. A total of 46 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, he said.      “We have not had a loss of life like this since back in the ’80s, where there was also the loss of five people,” he said. “I can’t remember anything like this.”      Photo      The heat and the height of the flames made it impossible to rescue the people remaining in the house, Antonio Conte, the acting Stamford fire chief, said at a news conference, according to The Associated Press.      The man who had been able to escape was screaming, “Help me, help me!” Mr. Mangano said. The man was led away, wearing only a T-shirt and boxer shorts, by firefighters.      “His hands were limp in front of him,” Mr. Mangano said.      Mr. Mangano, who lives around the corner from Ms. Badger’s home, said he did not know the family. When he arrived there, he said, “Flames were shooting out of every window — it was like a movie set.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Another neighbor, Sam Cingari, 71, said he was awakened at 5 a.m. by the piercing, anguished voice of a woman. “I heard someone screaming at the top of their lungs,” Mr. Cingari said in a telephone interview. “The flames were coming through the top floor, and I thought, ‘Nobody could possibly survive this.’ ”      A woman who answered the phone in Ms. Badger’s hospital room said she did not wish to talk.      Ms. Badger worked for Calvin Klein in the early 1990s, developing the popular underwear campaign with Mark Wahlberg. She founded her own company, specializing in beauty and luxury brands, in 1994; it is now called Badger & Winters Group. Ms. Badger had initiated divorce proceedings with her husband, Matthew, but they had an amicable relationship, the relative said.      Firefighters were still on the block in the afternoon on Sunday.

(Associated Press)      The building department determined that the 1.7 million house was unsafe and ordered it razed, Stamford fire chief Antonio Conte said.      The home's owner, advertising executive Madonna Badger, and her male acquaintance escaped from the fire. But Badger's three daughters _ a 10-year-old and 7-year-old twins _ and her parents, who were visiting for the holiday, died, police said.      Neighbors said they awoke to the sound of screaming shortly before 5 a.m. Sunday and rushed outside to help, but could do nothing as flames devoured the large, turreted home.      Police said the male acquaintance who escaped the blaze with Badger was a contractor working on the home. He was also hospitalized but his condition was not released.      Interviews with them will be finished Monday, Conte said. He had no details on the investigation.      A spokeswoman for Saks Fifth Avenue confirmed in a statement that Badger's father, Lomer Johnson, had worked as a Santa this year at its flagship store in Manhattan.      \\"Mr. Johnson was Saks Fifth Avenue's beloved Santa, and we are heartbroken about this terrible tragedy,\\" spokeswoman Julia Bently said.      Badger, an ad executive in the fashion industry, is the founder of New York City-based Badger & Winters Group. A supervisor at Stamford Hospital said she was treated and discharged by Sunday evening. Her whereabouts Monday was unknown.      Property records show Badger bought the five-bedroom, waterfront home for 1.7 million last year. The house was situated in Shippan Point, a wealthy neighborhood that juts into Long Island Sound.      The lot where the house once stood was covered with charred debris and cordoned off by police with tape on Monday. Passers-by left bouquets, stuffed animals and candles nearby.      Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a former mayor of Stamford, offered his condolences to Badger and her family in a statement and said her loss \\"defies explanation.\\"      The fire was Stamford's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people, Conte said. ||||| The fatal Connecticut fire that killed a fashion-marketing exec’s three children and parents was possibly sparked by embers from disposed fireplace ashes, The Post has learned.      The ashes from the family’s Christmas Eve yule log may have been still smoldering when they were left outside the 100-year-old, 1.7 million, Long Island Sound-view Victorian, said a source.      The wind may have blown the embers into the old, wooden building, sparking the blaze.      The already tragic story took another heartbreaking twist today as details emerged about how the oldest victim, Lomer Johnson, of Southbury, Conn. — a retiree who worked as jolly St. Nick — tried in vain to save his granddaughter.      “He had the little girl with him,” Stamford Fire Chief Antonio Conte told reporters yesterday.      Johnson, 71, was outside, face down on a small, jutting roof. The child was just inside the window.      “I think he had his granddaughter and he tried to get her out,” the chief said.      It was not clear which of the three little girls who perished in the flames he’d been trying to rescue.      Johnson and his wife, Pauline, were staying in the turreted, under-renovation home visiting their daughter, former Calvin Klein art director Madonna Badger, and Badger’s three daughters, 10-year-old Lily and 7-year-old twins Sarah and Grace.      The other two girls were found on the second floor, one floor down from all their bedrooms, the chief told reporters.      Pauline, the grandmother, was found on a staircase hallway between the second and third floors.      Of the seven in the house, only Badger, a founding partner at the top-tier branding firm Badger & Winters, and her companion, contractor Michael Borcina, survived the 5 a.m. blaze.      Badger, in the early 1990s, became a top fashion marketer with her spicy Marky Mark underwear ads and sultry Kate Moss Obsession ads for Calvin Klein.      Borcina, who was doing the renovation work on the house , remains in stable condition at a local hospital.      Firefighters told the chief that Borcina and Badger were both trying desperately to re-enter the house when they arrived and had to be restrained.      Badger had moved to the mansion with her girls from Manhattan at Thanksgiving 2010 and is estranged from her husband, the girls’ father, Matthew Badger.      The mansion’s charred remains — deemed a safety hazard — were razed by the city today at the conclusion of an on-site investigation and the removal of the bodies.      Stanford officials are expected to reveal the cause of the fire and other details — including whether the family had working smoke detectors, or whether the on-going renovations somehow abetted the flames —at a press conference tomorrow.      At Saks, where Johnson played Santa, shocked friends shared fond memories.      “He was a great guy, always joking,” an eighth-floor Saks security guard told The Post.      He and his wife were to celebrate their 49th wedding anniversary the day after the fire.      As for the girls, they were “just incredibly sweet and really magical,” said Sam Badger, a nephew of their father.’      “Lily was a little more quite, a little more reserved than her sisters,” he remembered.      “The twins just kind of seemed to bounce off each other, I suppose. They just seemed to be like one person, almost,” he said. “It’s really so sad to see them all suffer this fate. This is the most tragic thing.”      Additional reporting by Christina Carrega, Yoav Gonen, Laurel BabcockDaniel Gold and Mitchel Maddux      The mom was later released and transferred to an undisclosed location. She looked devastated as she briefly emerged from the hospital.      A relative of her estranged husband, Matthew Badger, said he is “absolutely distraught.”      He was at home in New York when the blaze broke out, and rushed to Stamford, according to cops.      “They were an amazing family,” the relative said.

The House was expected to consider it later in the day.      \\"While neither Democrats nor Republicans got everything they wanted,\\" Mr. Obama said in a statement, \\"this agreement is the right thing to do for our country and the House should pass it without delay.\\" He said it would \\"grow the economy and shrink our deficits in a balanced way.\\"      Despite concerns raised by some Senate Democrats, the bill was approved by a strong 89-8 vote, with a majority of both parties in support.      One of the most strident opponents was Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. Speaking on the Senate floor shortly before the vote, he declared the compromise benefited the wealthiest Americans at the expense of those who could afford it the least.      \\"Maybe now we are all believers of trickle-down economics. Not I,\\" Mr. Harkin said, declaring he would vote against the legislation.      The other seven senators voting against the bill were Democrats Tom Carper of Delaware and Michael Bennet of Colorado and Republicans Charles Grassley of Iowa, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida and Richard Shelby of Alabama.      The delay in approval meant that the U.S. technically went over the fiscal cliff at midnight, but with U.S. markets closed Tuesday, the impact of missing the deadline could be minimal. What damage the wrangling has caused—to the 2013 tax-filing season and consumer confidence—is already done.

Passage isn't assured in the House, where conservative Republicans are dismayed that the compromise raises taxes and doesn't include more cuts in federal spending. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said that the House could amend it and send it back to the Senate, but supporters of the compromise hope that the big bipartisan vote of approval in the Senate would help in propel it through the House and onto Mr. Obama's desk for his signature by Thursday.      The compromise was prepared for the Senate floor after Vice President Joe Biden, who brokered it with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) traveled to the Capitol for a late-night meeting with Senate Democrats, including many who harbored reservations about the deal.      \\"This shouldn't be the model for how to do things around here,\\" Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor shortly before the vote. \\"But I think we can say we've done some good for the country. We've taken care of the revenue side of this debate.\\"      Major elements of the compromise would permanently raise tax rates on income over 400,000 for individuals and 450,000 for jointly filing couples; raise rates on capital gains and dividends for those same households to Clinton-era levels of roughly 20%, from the current 15%; and limit the value of personal exemptions as well as the value of itemized deductions. Those last two restrictions would kick in at 250,000 for individuals and 300,000 for couples. Those limits disappeared in 2010.      The deal would also set the estate-tax rate at 40% on estates over 5 million; currently there's a 35% rate for estates over 5.12 million. The compromise rate isn't as high as the 45%, with a 3.5 million exemption, sought by Mr. Obama.      The deal would delay for two months part of the 110 billion in spending cuts that otherwise would have taken place in early January—cuts that would be replaced by tax increases and cuts in other programs.

Sudeep Reddy has details.      It continues an existing pay freeze for members of Congress for the current fiscal year, but doesn't extend the pay freeze for federal government workers.      The bill also included a measure preventing a sharp increase in the price of milk that was feared early in the new year, and extending some other agricultural programs through September. The last five-year farm bill expired at the end of last September due to the inability of lawmakers to reach a deal on the sweeping legislation.      Left out of the bill were any disaster-relief funds to help assist the recovery effort from the devastation caused by Superstorm Sandy across the Eastern U.S. in October. The Senate passed a bill last week providing 60 billion in emergency relief, but the House has yet to act to bring forward similar legislation.      The wider deal doesn't do much to control the U.S.'s long-term budget woes, which are driven largely by entitlement spending, especially on health care, left untouched in this agreement. And depending on the budget math and the ultimate fate of the spending cuts, it may not do much for the short-run deficit either.      By waiting until the last minute, and by cutting a deal on a much smaller scale than either side once envisioned, Washington also deferred many of its thorniest questions, though perhaps for only a few weeks. In late February or early March, the Treasury Department will run out of extraordinary measures to avoid exceeding the government's borrowing limit—which it otherwise would have reached on Monday—and Congress will need to approve an increase.      The delay in the spending cuts will run out about the same time. In effect, Congress has delayed the fiscal cliff by erecting a new and potentially more dangerous one.      Mr. Biden, asked about the outlook for the compromise, told reporters that his long experience on the Hill taught him two things. \\"You shouldn't predict how the Senate is going to vote before they vote—you won't make a lot of money,\\" he said. \\"And you surely shouldn't predict how the House is going to vote. But I feel very, very good.\\"      Asked what pitch he made to liberals who were skeptical of the deal, Mr. Biden said he told them, \\"This is Joe Biden and I'm your buddy.\\"      The changes in tax rates that were agreed to between Messrs. Biden and McConnell would raise roughly 600 billion in new revenue over 10 years. While that would represent the largest tax increase in decades, it would be less than 20% of the revenue that would have come in if policy makers allowed all the current tax breaks to expire on New Year's Eve.      Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images U.S. President Barack Obama makes a statement about fiscal cliff negotiations from the White House on Monday.      The Biden-McConnell deal is a classic compromise that included something for everyone to love—and hate. The key question is whether the positive components and the pressure of the Jan. 1 deadline are enough to neutralize the parts that raise objections. If not, attacks from the left and right could combine to topple the deal.      For Republicans, the bill includes the bitter medicine of the first income-tax rate increase since 1993, a violation of the anti-tax orthodoxy that has defined their party. On the other hand, it would codify the Bush-era lower income-tax rates for most Americans as permanent law, ending the recurring battles over how long they will endure.      For Democrats, the bill's tax increase makes good on their party's marquee promise in the 2012 election to raise taxes on upper-income Americans and not the middle class. But many Democrats, especially liberals, were infuriated that the bill set the income threshold as high as 450,000.      Heading into a meeting with Mr. Biden and Senate Democrats, Sen. Clare McCaskill of Missouri said, \\"Nobody's happy—that means it's probably a compromise.\\"      But Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) said that Mr. Biden at the meeting told Democrats that the compromise advanced Democratic Party principles. \\"He told us we can stand proud and tall that a lot of our values were protected,\\" said Ms. Boxer.      \\"There are many, many reasons people don't like the proposal but there is very close to unanimity that it's better than going over the cliff,\\" Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said after the meeting. \\"There are disagreements on this provision, that provision and other provisions are large and wide but the number of people who believe we should go over the cliff rather than vote for this is very small.\\"      One sticking point in the talks had been automatic spending cuts, known as the sequester, set to take effect in coming days.      Republicans had insisted the cuts of 24 billion be offset with savings in other areas. The White House wanted some of the offset to be in the form of tax increases, not just other spending cuts.      The deal pays for delaying the sequester with a mix of new taxes and spending cuts, according to several congressional aides.      Of that 24 billion cost, 12 billion would come from a shift in the rules affecting workplace-based 401(k) plans. The change would allow plan holders to roll their 401(k) assets into a Roth IRA plan, which would require them to pay taxes up front on any gains in their plan. The benefit for investors would be that disbursements from Roth plans in retirement are tax free.      In effect, the move provides more up-front revenue to the Treasury, but potentially at the cost of revenue over the long term—as taxes paid when individuals make withdrawals from their 401(k) plans would likely be far greater.      Other elements of the deal could be costly. It calls for a permanent fix to the alternative minimum tax, a one-year extension of unemployment insurance benefits, and a five-year extension of other tax breaks. Among them are tax credits for families of modest means, including one for college tuition, and an expanded earned income tax credit, which provides cash to working poor families who don't earn enough to pay income taxes. It also would block a scheduled cut in Medicare payments to doctors for one year.      The deal taking shape also would include tax breaks adopted by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year, aides with knowledge of the talks said. Among them was a one-year extension of the tax credit, with slight modifications that would allow wind-farm developers to claim the credit for projects that begin construction by Jan. 1, 2014.      Some Democrats and liberal activists said they believe the White House gave up too much, weakening Democrats' position heading into next round of budget talks with Republicans. \\"It's not a good deal if it gives more tax cuts to 2% and sets the stage for more hostage taking,\\" Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, said in a Twitter message.      Opposition to the deal also came quickly from conservatives. Heritage Action, a conservative political group, urged senators to vote against the bill and said it would be a \\"key vote\\" in its ratings of lawmakers.      \\"This kick-the-can approach, necessitated by a president who refuses to stop campaigning and start seriously addressing our nation's fiscal problems, is not an adequate solution to America's coming fiscal crisis, which is a result of overspending, not under-taxing,\\" the group said in a written statement.      —Andrew Ackerman, Patrick O'Connor and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.

Lee at carol.lee@wsj.com ||||| The Senate early on New Year's Day voted overwhelmingly in favor of a \\"fiscal cliff\\" deal that would extend tax rates on annual household incomes under 450,000 and postpone automatic spending cuts for two months.      The bill was approved in an 89-8 vote that came after only 10 minutes of formal floor debate and no official score from the Congressional Budget Office. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated it would reduce federal revenue by 3.93 trillion over the next decade compared to current law.      ADVERTISEMENT      Five Republicans and three Democrats voted against the bill: Sens.(D-Colo.),(D-Del.),(R-Iowa),(D-Iowa),(R-Utah),(R-Ky.),(R-Fla.) and Richard Shelby (R-Ala.).      Sens.

The 89-8 vote puts pressure on the GOP-led House to approve the legislation, though it remains to be seen if most House Republicans will back a bill that would add to the deficit and lacks the deep spending cuts that conservatives have been calling for.            It is unclear when the House will vote to pass or possibly amend the Senate-passed measure.

The passage of the bill is a significant victory for Biden, who might run for president in 2016, and McConnell, who is up for reelection next year.            The legislation would indefinitely extend the Bush-era income tax rates on individual incomes up to 400,000 and family incomes up to 450,000. Also, it sets the estate tax rate at 40 percent, up from 35 percent, and exempts inheritances below 5 million.      It would postpone the automatic spending cuts known as the sequester for two months and offset the 24 billion cost of the delay with a mix of spending cuts and new revenues. The measure would also extend unemployment benefits for one year without offsetting their impact on the deficit, preventing 2 million people from losing government assistance.      And it would prevent a hike in congressional pay that was authorized in an executive order from President Obama to raise federal worker pay.      Biden made a late-night visit to Capitol Hill to convince Democrats to back the agreement, but he did not need to do much arm-twisting.      \\"I am feeling very, very good. I think we'll get a very good vote tonight,’ Biden said, leaving the meeting with Democrats.      Obama called on the House to pass the Senate measure \\"without delay.\\"      \\"This agreement will also grow the economy and shrink our deficits in a balanced way – by investing in our middle class, and by asking the wealthy to pay a little more,\\" Obama said in a statement following the vote.      \\"There’s more work to do to reduce our deficits, and I’m willing to do it,\\" he added.      Senate approval sends the bill to the House, where Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerVeterans are left out of medical marijuana protections Former top Treasury official to head private equity group GOP strategist Steve Schmidt denounces party, will vote for Democrats MORE (R-Ohio) said the House will review the Senate bill.      With the stage set for a New Year’s Day vote, it remains unclear if the House will vote on the bill before Thursday, when the 113th Congress will be sworn in.            “The House will honor its commitment to consider the Senate agreement if it is passed,” Boehner John Andrew BoehnerVeterans are left out of medical marijuana protections Former top Treasury official to head private equity group GOP strategist Steve Schmidt denounces party, will vote for Democrats MORE said. “Decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members — and the American people — have been able to review the legislation.”            Boehner is not a fan of moving significant legislation in lame-duck sessions, and he has made it a top priority to give members and the public time to read bills before scheduling votes on them.            The bill would appear to be a hard sell with House Republicans, many of whom objected to an earlier bill sought by Boehner that extended tax rates on annual incomes under 1 million as a tax hike. However, unlike Boehner's \\"Plan B\\" bill, the Senate-passed measure will attract significant support from House Democrats.      The Senate measure includes few spending cuts, which House Republicans have repeatedly demanded.      “I don’t see any balance yet, that’s the fundamental problem,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzTucker Carlson: Ruling class cares more about foreigners than their own people Fox's Kennedy chides Chaffetz on child migrants: 'I’m sure these mini rapists all have bombs strapped to their chests' After FBI cleared by IG report, GOP must reform itself MORE (R-Utah) told The Hill. “If you don’t cut spending, there’s no way you’re going to pick up Republican votes.”      Heritage Action for American, a conservative advocacy group, urged lawmakers to oppose the deal.      “To be clear, this is a tax increase. In 2013, the top marginal rate, death tax, and taxes on long-term capital gains and dividends will all be higher than in 2012. Comparing tax rates to hypothetical rates that have hardly any support is nothing more than misleading Washington spin,” the group declared in a statement.      Liberal groups and labor unions have begun to line up against the deal, as well. They complained the White House and Democrats were giving up too much, particularly after Obama campaigned on a pledge to raise tax rates on households with annual income above 250,000.      “We just finished an election in which the American people made clear that they want the wealthiest 2 percent to finally pay their fair share of taxes, but this agreement fails to meet that test,” said Justin Ruben, executive director of MoveOn.org. “Voters gave President Obama a mandate to end the Bush tax cuts for those making more than 250,000. He has not delivered.”      “Its [sic] not a good fiscal cliff deal if it gives more tax cuts to 2 percent and sets the stage for more hostage taking,” AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka wrote in a Twitter post on Monday night.      House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) remained non-committal publicly but has signed off the deal in private, according to a source familiar with the talks.      “I understand at the present time, Senate Democrats are meeting with the Vice President. When a final agreement is reached and passed by the Senate, I will present it to the House Democratic Caucus,” she said in a statement.      Some Senate Democrats balked at the last minute over a Republican demand to index the estate tax exemption for inflation, but finally relented after centrists such as Sen. Max Baucus Max Sieben BaucusClients’ Cohen ties become PR liability Green Party puts Dem seat at risk in Montana Business groups worried about Trump's China tariffs plan MORE (D-Mont.) weighed in to support the provision.      In the end, both Democratic and Republican senators concluded it was better to accept a deal despite their objections than go over the fiscal cliff.      “There is a feeling, again, that it’s not that this proposal is regarded as great or is loved, in any way, but it’s a lot better than going over the cliff,” Sen.

Senate Republicans also said an imperfect deal is better than letting middle-class families get hit with income tax increases and 109 billion in domestic and defense spending cuts take place.      Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said: \\"It's not something that any of us would say, 'Oh, I love it.' I don't love it, but I think it is a very good job of negotiating where there are some wins and some losses and it's about even.\\"      The legislation will add trillions of dollars to the federal deficit over the next 10 years compared to current law, under which the Bush-era tax rates expired at midnight. White House officials and Senate Democratic aides said tax increases on the wealthy would raise about 620 billion in revenue compared to current policy.      The bill includes a host of tax rate extensions, including five-year extensions of the college tuition tax credit, the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, which were part of the 2009 economic stimulus package.      It sets the capital gains and dividends tax rate at 20 percent, up from 15 percent. Capital gains and dividend income would be taxed at 23.8 percent for singles earning above 400,000 annually and families earning more than 450,000, according to a White House fact sheet.      It reinstates the Clinton-era limit itemized deductions for individuals earning more than 250,000 a year and families earning above 300,000.      It permanently patches the Alternative Minimum Tax and extends a variety of expiring business and energy tax provisions for one year, including the research and experimentation tax credit and 50 percent bonus depreciation.      The legislation will freeze scheduled cuts to doctors’ Medicare payments for one year, paying for them with spending cuts in other healthcare spending. This avoids a 27 percent cut in reimbursements to doctors treating Medicare patients.      White House officials argue the agreement leaves substantial opportunity to further reduce tax breaks for high-income households, reform corporate tax rates and reform entitlement programs in the 113th Congress.      It will also include a one-year extension of the 2008 farm bill without dairy reforms, to the chagrin of Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow Deborah (Debbie) Ann StabenowSenate passes mammoth farm bill Moderates need to hold firm against radical right on Farm Bill New Kid Rock film explores political divide MORE (D-Mich.).      \\"This is Mitch McConnell's farm bill\\" she said. \\"I will vote for it but I am on record that I am not happy with what was done to agriculture.\\"      The farm bill provision stops a possible doubling of milk prices but does not contain reforms and 24 billion in deficit reduction in a Senate passed five-year bill.                  —Erik Wasson, Vicki Needham and Mike Lillis contributed.      This report was originally published at 2:08 a.m. and last updated at 10:27 a.m. ||||| WASHINGTON Last-minute efforts to step back from the \\"fiscal cliff\\" ran into trouble on Tuesday as Republicans in the House of Representatives balked at a deal that would prevent Washington from pushing the world's biggest economy into a recession.      House Republicans complained that a bill passed by the Senate in a late-night show of unity to prevent a budget crisis contained tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans but no spending cuts. Some conservatives sought to change the bill to add cuts.      That would set up a high-stakes showdown between the two chambers and risk a stinging rebuke from financial markets that are due to open in Asia in a few hours.      The Senate would refuse to accept any changes to the bill, a Senate aide said, and it appeared increasingly possible that Congress could push the country over the fiscal cliff after all, despite months of effort.      Strictly speaking, the United States went over the cliff in the first minutes of the New Year because Congress failed to produce legislation to halt 600 billion of tax hikes and spending cuts that start kicking in on January 1.      But with financial markets and federal government offices closed for the New Year's Day holiday, lawmakers had a little more time to work out a compromise without real-world consequences.      The Senate bill drew overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats alike when it passed by a vote of 89 to 8.      But Republicans who control the House expressed wide dismay with the measure, which includes only 12 billion in spending cuts along with 620 billion in tax increases on top earners.      Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House, told reporters after huddling with other Republicans that he does not support the Senate's bill.      \\"The lack of spending cuts in the Senate bill was a universal concern amongst members in today's meeting. Conversations with members will continue throughout the afternoon on the path forward,\\" said Cantor spokesman Rory Cooper.      Republicans returned for a second meeting at 5:15 p.m. EST (2215 GMT).      Republicans could face a backlash if they scuttle the deal. Income tax rates rose back to 1990s levels for all Americans at midnight, and across-the-board spending cuts on defense and domestic programs would begin to kick in on Wednesday.      Economists say the combination of tax cuts and spending cuts could cause the economy to shrink, and public opinion polls show Republicans would shoulder the blame.      MARKET DISCIPLINE?      Lingering uncertainty over U.S. fiscal policy has unnerved investors and depressed business activity for months.      Financial markets have staved off a steep plunge on the assumption that Washington would ultimately avoid pushing the country off the fiscal cliff into a recession.      Several Republicans said the fight could spill over until Wednesday, at which point they could be pressured by financial markets to accept the Senate bill.      \\"Everyone knows once the markets open tomorrow our courage drops in direct proportion to the market fall,\\" said one Republican lawmaker who spoke on condition of anonymity.      The bill passed by the Democratic-led Senate at around 2 a.m. would raise income taxes on families earning more than 450,000 per year and limit the amount of deductions they can take to lower their tax bill.      Low temporary rates that have been in place for less-affluent taxpayers for the past decade would be made permanent, along with a range of targeted tax breaks put in place to fight the 2009 economic downturn.      However, workers would see up to 2,000 more taken out of their paychecks annually as a temporary payroll tax cut was set to expire.      The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the Senate bill would increase budget deficits by nearly 4 trillion over the coming 10 years, compared to the budget savings that would occur if the extreme measures of the cliff were to kick in.      But the bill would actually save 650 billion during that time period when measured against the tax and spending policies that were in effect on Monday, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent group that has pushed for more aggressive deficit savings.

Given the question: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

They published their findings in a peer reviewed publication.  Which team didn't observe a stronger warming in spring?

However, it does not provide any information about statues of court jesters in the plaza. Thus, the given premise does not entail or support the hypothesis \\"Plaza de Oriente contains statues of all the court jesters that Spain has had,\\" as it only explicitly mentions statues of Spanish kings and queens. To determine if the hypothesis is accurate, we would need additional information explicitly stating the presence of court jester statues in the plaza, or information regarding the existence of a comprehensive collection of court jester statues. It is important to note that the absence of information in the premise regarding the presence of court jester statues does not necessarily negate or disprove the hypothesis. It simply means that based on the provided information, we cannot confidently conclude that the hypothesis is accurate or supported. In conclusion, the given premise offers information about the Plaza de Oriente's location near the Royal Palace, its royal statues, and its proximity to the Teatro Real, but does not provide any insight into the presence of statues commemorating Spanish court jesters.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: -  Magma cools inside the crust - Magma crystalizes - Lava cools on the surface - Lava crystalizes  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The processes you've listed outline the creation and crystallization of igneous rocks, both intrusive (formed inside the Earth's crust) like granite and extrusive (formed on the Earth's surface) like basalt. Here's how it generally works: 1. Magma is formed in the Earth's mantle due to high temperatures. Sometimes, due to tectonic activity, this magma is forced upward into the cooler layers of the Earth's crust. 2. In case of an intrusive scenario, if the magma doesn't make it all the way to the surface and cools slowly within the crust, it solidifies and forms large crystals, resulting in intrusive igneous rocks. 3. If the magma reaches the surface of the Earth (typically through a volcano), it is termed as lava. 4. Once on the surface, this lava cools and solidifies much more rapidly due to the much lower temperatures compared to beneath the Earth's crust. This rapid cooling doesn't allow the mineral constituents to form large crystals, hence, they form very small crystals or may even form glass, resulting in extrusive igneous rocks. After the steps you've listed, the next step depends on the geological and weather conditions.  In terms of geological processes, the created rock may not be the end of its journey as it may potentially be subjected to other geological processes such as metamorphism and sedimentation. If the rock undergoes metamorphism due to high pressure and temperature, it can be altered into a different form known as a metamorphic rock. Or if the rock weathers and erodes into smaller pieces, and these sediments accumulate and compact over time, they can form sedimentary rock. But to keep it simple and not going into another geologic process, the last step after the magma and lava have cooled and crystallized is said to be the formation of igneous rock. For magma cooling in the crust and crystallizing, it forms intrusive igneous rock, while for lava that cools on the surface and crystallizes quickly, it forms extrusive igneous rock."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

Today, we're going to learn about cholesterol and how we can understand the numbers our doctor tells us. Just like you need to know your A-B-Cs in school, we need to know our cholesterol numbers too. Let's get started! First, when we visit the doctor, they take some blood from us to check all the different things inside it. One of those things is cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that our body uses to keep us healthy. But, sometimes our body can make too much of it, and that's when it may cause some problems. Let's learn how to read our cholesterol measurements! 1. Assess your LDL level: LDL stands for \\"Low-Density Lipoprotein.\\" It's also known as the \\"bad\\" cholesterol because having too much of it can cause problems in our heart. The doctor will tell us if our LDL level is good, or if it's too high. 2. Examine your HDL level: HDL is short for \\"High-Density Lipoprotein.\\" This is the \\"good\\" cholesterol because it helps keep our heart healthy. We want this number to be high to make sure we're doing well! 3. Assess your triglyceride level: Triglycerides are another type of fat in our blood. Like the bad cholesterol, too much of this can also cause problems. The doctor will let us know if we need to lower this number as well. Now that we understand those numbers, let's find out how to calculate our total cholesterol. 4. Plug your numbers into the equation for total cholesterol: To find our total cholesterol number, we have to add our LDL and HDL numbers and then add 20% (or two-tenths) of our triglyceride number. 5. Calculate your total cholesterol: Once you've done the math, you'll get your total cholesterol number. This will help the doctor see if our overall cholesterol is in a healthy range. 6. Assess your total cholesterol level: The doctor will tell us if our total cholesterol level is too high or if it's just right. If it's too high, don't worry! We can work on making it better. 7. Have your doctor go over the results with you: Our doctor will make sure we understand all the numbers and let us know if there are any changes we need to make. 8. Take steps to lower your cholesterol: If our doctor says we need to work on our cholesterol, there are steps we can take! We can eat healthy foods, exercise, and make sure we take care of our body to keep our cholesterol in check. So, that's it! Now you know what cholesterol is and how to understand the numbers your doctor tells you. Learning about our health is important, just like learning our A-B-Cs. Remember to keep being the amazing, smart little kid you are, and take good care of your body!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Male Urethra The male urethra passes through the prostate gland immediately inferior to the bladder before passing below the pubic symphysis (see Figure 25.3b). The length of the male urethra varies between men but averages 20 cm in length. It is divided into four regions: the preprostatic urethra, the prostatic urethra, the membranous urethra, and the spongy or penile urethra. The preprostatic urethra is very short and incorporated into the bladder wall. The prostatic urethra passes through the prostate gland. During sexual intercourse, it receives sperm via the ejaculatory ducts and secretions from the seminal vesicles. Paired Cowper’s glands (bulbourethral glands) produce and secrete mucus into the urethra to buffer urethral pH during sexual stimulation. The mucus neutralizes the usually acidic environment and lubricates the urethra, decreasing the resistance to ejaculation. The membranous urethra passes through the deep muscles of the perineum, where it is invested by the overlying urethral sphincters. The spongy urethra exits at the tip (external urethral orifice) of the penis after passing through the corpus spongiosum. Mucous glands are found along much of the length of the urethra and protect the urethra from extremes of urine pH. Innervation is the same in both males and females.

Home-based manufacturing operations were active year round. Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises. In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58 percent of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture.

Review: I was blown away by the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. A hardened sci-fi fan, I like to think I can pick out the good stuff from the BS, and this was good stuff. As such, when I first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago I got a sick feeling in my gut. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be reused in Caprica, which wouldn't work at all. BSG's story, of a mournful ragged band of survivors, trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors. Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays that civilization in it's cold and decadent heyday. The overall vibe I got from Caprica was similar to that of Minority Report, minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In true BSG form, Caprica has in it's first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom, racism, the morality of playing God and the nature of the human soul. The casting for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and deep, from the obsessive and distant scientist-turned-entrepreneur, to his troubled and willful daughter, each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles. Music, which was used so powerfully in BSG, also plays a significant role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show it's own feeling quite distinct from either of it's predecessors.  The new Caprica is definitely it's own show, pulling from the Battlestar franchise only as much as it needs. I look forward to the full series. Now, what is this review like?

Question: \\"Who denied Capote's authorship?\\"  Context: \\"Lee's childhood friend, author Truman Capote, wrote on the dust jacket of the first edition, \\"Someone rare has written this very fine first novel: a writer with the liveliest sense of life, and the warmest, most authentic sense of humor. A touching book; and so funny, so likeable.\\" This comment has been construed to suggest that Capote wrote the book or edited it heavily. In 2003, a Tuscaloosa newspaper quoted Capote's biological father, Archulus Persons, as claiming that Capote had written \\"almost all\\" of the book. In 2006, a Capote letter was donated to Monroeville's literary heritage museum; in a letter to a neighbor in Monroeville in 1959, Capote mentioned that Lee was writing a book that was to be published soon. Extensive notes between Lee and her editor at Lippincott also refute the rumor of Capote's authorship. Lee's older sister, Alice, responded to the rumor, saying: \\"That's the biggest lie ever told.\\"\\"  Answer:","output":"The denial of Truman Capote's authorship of Harper Lee's famous novel \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" comes from multiple sources, each providing pieces of evidence and testimonials to refute the claims and rumors that he wrote or heavily edited the book. Firstly, the quote from the dust jacket of the first edition written by Capote himself, praising the book and Harper Lee's writing, has been misconstrued by some to suggest his involvement in the book's creation. However, it is not uncommon for authors to provide endorsements or reviews for their colleagues and friends' works, and a positive endorsement does not necessarily indicate authorship. The claim that Capote wrote \\"almost all\\" of the book came from Archulus Persons, his biological father, as quoted by a Tuscaloosa newspaper in 2003. This single statement fueled the rumor of possible authorship by Capote. However, given that only one person made this claim, it is important to consider the credibility and supporting evidence, or lack thereof, before accepting it. In 2006, a letter from Capote was donated to Monroeville's literary heritage museum. In it, Capote writes to a neighbor in Monroeville about Harper Lee working on a book that is set to be published soon. This letter shows that Capote was aware of Lee's work on the novel, and his correspondence does not suggest that he had any role in its creation. Moreover, extensive notes exchanged between Harper Lee and her editor at Lippincott further dispute Capote's authorship. The notes contain detailed discussions of the book's storyline, characters, and themes, displaying a clear collaboration and author-editor relationship between Harper Lee and her editor. Perhaps the most convincing and significant denial comes from Harper Lee's own family. Her older sister, Alice, staunchly dismissed the notion of Capote's authorship, stating, \\"That's the biggest lie ever told.\\" It is highly unlikely that a close family member, who would have had intimate knowledge of the book's creation, would make such a statement if there were any truth to the rumor. In conclusion, the denial of Truman Capote's authorship of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is supported by multiple sources, including the author's own words in a dust jacket endorsement, a letter written by Capote, extensive notes between Harper Lee and her editor, and most importantly, a firm denial from her older sister Alice. While the rumors of authorship have persisted over time, the evidence and testimonies presented strongly refute any claims that Truman Capote wrote or heavily edited Harper Lee's timeless classic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pre-shrunk shirts are increasingly common..Choose from options above and answer: What most naturally follows? How to shrink a cotton t shirt  Prepare a large, boiling pot of water.  Clothing companies often stretch out their fabric so that less cloth is needed to manufacture a shirt. Washing the cotton shirt, or submerging it, in warm water will help the cloth in the shirt shrink back to its natural state. Answer:","output":"To shrink a cotton t-shirt, follow these steps: 1. Check the care label on your t-shirt: Before you begin the process of shrinking your cotton t-shirt, make sure to check the care label for any specific washing instructions or warnings. Some garments may not be suitable for this method, or may require a different technique. 2. Fill a large pot with water: Choose a pot that's large enough to hold your t-shirt comfortably without having to fold or scrunch it. Fill the pot with enough water to fully submerge the shirt. 3. Heat the water: Place the pot on the stove and heat the water until it reaches a rolling boil. Be cautious not to let the water boil for too long, as it can damage the fabric of your shirt. 4. Submerge the t-shirt: Carefully place the t-shirt into the boiling water, making sure it is fully submerged. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to gently stir the shirt in the water, ensuring that it's evenly exposed to the heat. 5. Boil the t-shirt for a few minutes: Allow the shirt to boil in the water for 3-5 minutes, depending on how much you want to shrink it. Keep an eye on it to avoid any damage to the fabric. 6. Remove the t-shirt and let it cool: Carefully remove the shirt from the boiling water, using tongs or a large spoon to avoid burning yourself. Place the shirt on a flat surface and allow it to cool for a few minutes. 7. Rinse the t-shirt with cold water: Once the shirt has cooled down, rinse it under cold water to help set the shrinkage and remove any excess dye. 8. Dry the shirt: Gently wring out any excess water from the shirt, and then place it in the dryer on a low heat setting. Alternatively, you can lay it flat to air-dry, making sure to reshape it as needed. 9. Check the fit: Once the shirt is completely dry, try it on to ensure that it has shrunk to the desired size. If it's still too big, repeat the process as necessary. Keep in mind that shrinking a cotton t-shirt may alter its appearance and feel, so it's essential to monitor the process carefully and follow the care label's instructions. Additionally, consider opting for pre-shrunk garments when shopping to avoid having to deal with this issue in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Alex Salmond will demand the power to hold another independence referendum in return for propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street next year. The outgoing First Minister has revealed his price for the SNP's support should there be a hung parliament following May's General Election. The move raises the prospect of Mr Miliband facing the unenviable choice of running a majority government or risking another vote on the future of the Union. Scroll down for video. Outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond has revealed his price for the SNP's support should there be a hung parliament following May's General Election. Mr Salmond makes his final appearance at First Minister's Questions today  after more than seven years in office. As his 'divisive' reign comes to an end, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has called on his successor Nicola Sturgeon to 'hit the reset button' and fix the relationship between Westminster and Holyrood. Mr Carmichael blasted the Scottish Government for 'taking its eye off the ball' in recent years and urged ministers to focus on their 'day jobs' now that voters have rejected separation. He also singled out Education Secretary Mike Russell for failing to 'respect' the result of the referendum after the minister blamed a fall in teacher numbers on those who support the Union. But Mr Salmond, 59, used a press conference yesterday to insist that independence will happen within his own lifetime. He also backtracked from his pre-referendum vow that September's contest was a 'once in a generation, perhaps even a lifetime, opportunity' and said another referendum could happen 'sooner' than Unionist supporters would like. His comments will alarm more than 2million Scots who turned out to reject independence, many of whom are still recovering from the divisions caused by the constitutional battle. Mr Salmond is widely expected to launch a bid to return to Westminster as an MP once he hands over power to Miss Sturgeon, where he hopes to be 'kingmaker' following next year's General Election. In an interview with Newsweek Europe to be published tomorrow, the SNP leader suggests he would also fight for voters in northern England. 'Who knows, there might be one or two things we can knock off for the good citizens of Liverpool and Newcastle, because they badly need a champion of some sort,' he said. 'Is England going to be safer in my hands or in the hands of this coalition government or of Nigel Farage? Much safer in my hands. I'll do my best.' Ed Miliband has seen a collapse in support for Labour in Scotland, with voters switching to the SNP. The SNP will not enter a formal coalition with the Tories, but has not ruled out a deal with Labour. However, should the arithmetic allow it, a 'confidence and supply' system is more likely where the party's MPs would vote against any no confidence vote in a Labour-led government and would allow its budget to pass. 'There is plenty of scope to find things which are really important to you but are really not that important to the government,' he told Newsweek. 'It wouldn't be the greatest tragedy in the world, for example, for Westminster to accept the reality that the Scottish parliament should run its own elections, its own referendum.' Elections are currently reserved to Westminster and the recent referendum was only made legally-binding following a temporary deal between David Cameron and Mr Salmond. The First Minister claimed the threat to the Union by handing over this power would not be of 'immediate pressing concern [to Westminster] compared to the enormity, for example, of Ed Miliband's survival as Prime Minister, which I am sure he would in that situation believe to be of the ultimate importance to the future of everything.' Last night, a senior Scottish Labour MP said the idea was a non-starter because there would be no mandate to devolve elections and it would be 'going against the settled will of the Scottish voters'. Mr Carmichael said it is time to leave the constitutional debate behind. 'For us all in politics, there's a job of work to be done now to move Scotland on from being divided between the 55 [per cent who voted No] and the 45, to heal some of the deep and quite understandable divisions that there were in the course of the referendum,' he said. 'With Nicola taking over the reins as SNP leader and then as First Minister next week… I hope that this will be a point when we can hit the reset button on the relationship between the two governments.' Mr Carmichael criticised comments made by the First Minister about the prospect of another referendum on independence. 'I'm hoping that once some of the dust settles that they will accept that we're not returning to the referendum question any time soon, because principally that would be very bad for Scotland's economy,' he said. But during a press conference in his official Bute House residence yesterday, Mr Salmond said: 'It's the people who decide whether a constitutional referendum should be held. 'I did see a number of indications in two polls last week that at least there is strong support among the people of Scotland for a constitutional referendum rather sooner.' Asked if he thought independence would happen within his lifetime, he replied: 'Yes indeed.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"Alex Salmond, who used to be in charge of Scotland, said he might help a man named Ed Miliband lead the United Kingdom. But, he will only help if he is allowed to have another vote on whether Scotland should be its own country. This might make it hard for Mr. Miliband to decide if he wants the help or not. Some people are worried that Scotland might have another vote to be its own country. They hope that everyone can work together and fix any problems instead of having more votes on whether to separate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.

Last Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed.

In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college. As soon as I got there I called AAA  and arranged for a tow truck   to meet me at my car after class.

Suggested answer: Yale College was transformed, beginning in the 1930s, through the establishment of residential colleges : 12 now exist and two more are planned. Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"No, you should not validate the suggested answer as it does not address the original question. The given response discusses the transformation of Yale College through the establishment of residential colleges, which is not relevant to the distance between Harvard University and Yale University. The distance between Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, can be measured in various ways, such as driving distance, straight-line distance, or travel time. However, to provide you with a better answer, I will focus on the driving distance between the two universities, which is a common method of measurement when discussing distances. The driving distance between Harvard University and Yale University is approximately 135 miles (217 kilometers) via I-90 E and I-95 S. This route typically takes around 2 hours and 30 minutes to drive, depending on traffic conditions. So, a more appropriate answer to the question \\"How many miles is Harvard University from Yale University?\\" would be: \\"The driving distance between Harvard University and Yale University is approximately 135 miles (217 kilometers), and it typically takes around 2 hours and 30 minutes to drive between the two universities via I-90 E and I-95 S.\\" Of course, this answer can be adjusted if you want to mention other methods of measuring distance or alternative routes. But the key point is that the original question's focus is on the distance between the two universities, and the suggested answer should address that topic instead of discussing unrelated aspects of Yale's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: -- activation energy; -- fragments; -- motors; -- kinetic energy; -- oscillations; -- shards; -- heat energy; -- energy; Q: Fact 1: An incandescent light bulb converts electricity into light by sending electricity through a filament.  Fact 2: Light is the oscillations in the electric field.  Given the two facts above, incandescent bulbs convert electricity into what in the electric field? A:","output":"Given the two facts above, incandescent bulbs convert electricity into oscillations in the electric field. To provide a detailed explanation, let's dive deeper into the process: Incandescent light bulbs work on the principle of incandescence, which is the emission of light from a hot object due to the conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic radiation, such as light. In incandescent bulbs, this process involves the conversion of electrical energy into heat energy, which then leads to the emission of light as oscillations in the electric field. 1. Electrical Energy: It starts when the electrical energy is supplied from the power source to the incandescent bulb. The energy is in the form of an electric current, which flows through the conductive material of the bulb and into the filament. 2. Heat Energy Conversion: A filament is typically made of tungsten, a material with a high melting temperature and resistance to electricity. When the electric current flows through the filament, the resistance causes the filament to heat up through a process called Joule heating. The filament's temperature increases significantly, causing it to emit thermal energy in the form of photons. 3. Emission of Light: As the filament's temperature rises, it starts emitting electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. The oscillations in the electric field that constitute light waves are produced by the accelerated movement of charged particles (electrons) within the filament. These oscillations propagate away from the filament as electromagnetic waves and are perceived as visible light by our eyes. In summary, an incandescent light bulb converts electricity into light by first transforming the electrical energy into heat energy through Joule heating of the filament. The heated filament then emits light as oscillations in the electric field, which are essentially the result of accelerated electrons within the filament producing electromagnetic waves. Hence, incandescent bulbs can be said to convert electricity into oscillations in the electric field to create visible light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn?  Hint: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.

The exact time of the liftoff varies from source to source and is mentioned as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's nose cone was jettisoned successfully; however the \\"Block A\\" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to 40 °C (104 °F). After three hours of weightlessness, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, \\"It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.\\"Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2—including Laika's remains—disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958.","output":"Dimitri Malashenkov submitted a paper explaining how Laika died in the city of Houston, Texas.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Despite his lack of experience in composing film music, Prokofiev began his Kijé score confidently, later writing: \\"I somehow had no doubts whatever about the musical language for the film\\". He told the producers, \\"What is important to me is the era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero\\", and warned them not to expect mere musical \\"illustrations\\". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the Kijé score is one of several works, including the Classical Symphony, The Love of Three Oranges, Cinderella, and War and Peace, that show \\"the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century\\". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's Boléro in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the saxophone, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer Gerard McBurney has pointed out the \\"haunting sounds of the tenor saxophone\\" that punctuate the Kijé music.The critic Ernest Chapman refers to Prokofiev's \\"unfailingly witty and melodious score\\". It comprises only about 15 minutes of music, written as a series of 16 short fragments or leitmotifs which are repeated at appropriate times during the film's duration, to highlight specific moments in the drama. This approach was a departure in film music from the established form of broad symphonic movements, and was described by Prokofiev's biographer Daniel Jaffé as \\"well ahead of its time ... one of the most celebrated [film scores] of that era\\".

Solve this instance: Paragraph- Sent 1: Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because  Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Sent 2: Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Sent 3: Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. Sent 4: At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Sent 5: Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Sent 6: Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. Sent 7: The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. Sent 8: The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. Sent 9: When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. Sent 10: A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Sent 11:  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Sent 12: Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Sent 13:  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. Sent 14: International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Sent 15: Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. Sent 16: As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Sent 17: Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll.

Set up in 2005 as an \\"arm's length\\" government body, the authority is responsible for managing the UK's nuclear waste. Last week Cumbria County Council rejected proposals to build a new underground nuclear waste storage facility in the area, deciding not to press ahead with a study for a possible site. The Public Accounts Committee report follows criticisms by the National Audit Office (NAO) in November. The NAO said rundown buildings posed \\"intolerable risks to people and the environment\\". Margaret Hodge MP, chairwoman of the committee, said an \\"enormous legacy\\" of nuclear waste had been allowed to build up at the plant. \\"Over decades, successive governments have failed to get to grips with this critical problem, to the point where the total lifetime cost of decommissioning the site has now reached £67.5 billion, and there's no indication of when that cost will stop rising,\\" she said. \\"Furthermore, now that Cumbria County Council has ruled out West Cumbria as the site of the proposed geological disposal facility, a solution to the problem of long-term storage of the waste is as far away as ever.\\" The committee's report also calls for a \\"real sense of urgency\\" to avoid risk and costs escalating.

He said: \\"Tough decisions about how we ultimately decommission the site had simply been put off for future generations to deal with. \\"We are now facing up to those challenges and for the first time we have a proper plan in place for the decommissioning of Sellafield. \\"Since the creation of the NDA in 2005, the financial investment at Sellafield has increased from £900m to over £1.5bn a year. \\"Of course, not everything has gone smoothly on such a complex and highly-technical programme, and the report has rightly pointed to areas where we and the site need to do better.\\" The Public Accounts Committee said 12 of the site's 14 projects were behind schedule and five of them over budget. \\"This is an area of considerable deprivation with high unemployment. We are looking for there to be clearer ambition that spending on this huge scale contributes to creating jobs and supports sustainable growth in the region and the UK,\\" said Mrs Hodge, the Labour MP for Barking and former minister. Gary Smith, national officer of the GMB union, said: \\"There is an increasing lack of trust in the consortium that runs the site both amongst the workforce and the wider community. \\"There needs to be immediate change at the top of the consortium and a radical re-evaluation of the piecemeal hiving-off of the nuclear sector to private companies that are clearly ill-equipped to cope and have little interest in ensuring Britain has world-class nuclear facilities.\\" Last Wednesday's county council decision saw the authority's cabinet vote against progressing to the next stage of a process that would have seen studies take place in search of a suitable location for an underground nuclear dump. Cumbria was the only area still considering housing the repository. About 9,000 people are employed at Sellafield where radioactive waste lies in ponds and silos.","output":"The Public Accounts Committee's report highlights missed deadlines and budget overruns in the Cumbria site cleanup, and attributes the issue to successive governments' failure to address the large amounts of nuclear waste stored at the site."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Communication The first major model for communication was introduced by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver for Bell Laboratories in 1949 The original model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technologies. Their initial model consisted of three primary parts: sender, channel, and receiver. The sender was the part of a telephone a person spoke into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone where one could hear the other person. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that often there is static that interferes with one listening to a telephone conversation, which they deemed noise.

Next question: origin of beauty is in the eye of the beholder?","output":"Task: Determine the origin of the phrase \\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\\" Step 1: Research the phrase and its origin To find the origin of this phrase, I will research its history and when it was first used. I will review literature, quotes, and other possible sources where the phrase might have appeared. Step 2: Determine the original source After researching, I will try to pinpoint the original source, or at least the first known usage of the phrase, and identify its author. Step 3: Understand the author's context Once I've found the author, I will dive into the context in which the phrase was used and any possible influences that led to its conception. This background information will help me provide a well-rounded explanation of the phrase's origin. Step 4: Present the findings I will present the findings, stating the origin and any relevant context around the phrase \\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\\" Findings: The concept behind the phrase \\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\" can be traced to ancient Greek philosopher Plato in 4th century B.C. The Greek phrase is \\"κάλλος γαρ οψις προυσειδες,\\" which can be translated as \\"for beautiful things, vision is for what's ahead.\\" However, the modern form of the phrase is believed to have originated in a 1588 manuscript called Margaret of Newcastle, where English playwright John Lyly wrote, \\"As the proverb sayth, 'Any bee what it will, and none bee justified,'\\" which means that beauty cannot be judged objectively. It wasn't until 1878 that the phrase \\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\" appeared in its current form. Irish novelist Margaret Wolfe Hungerford used it in her book \\"Molly Bawn,\\" making her its first known author. The phrase has since become commonly used to express the idea that what one person finds beautiful may not be the same for other people, emphasizing the subjectivity of personal preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Or more likely, the 21-year-old is deliberately provoking authorities. Her crime? She posted a photo of herself lighting a cigarette with a candle in a Russian Orthodox church in the city of Belgorod, reports the Moscow Times. For that, she has been charged with \\"insulting the feelings of religious believers,\\" under a law that came about in the wake of the stunts pulled by the feminist punk group Pussy Riot. She faces up to three years in prison, reports the London Times. \\"This is bad behavior, of course, but she should simply have been kicked out of the church,\\" says Alexander Verkhovsky, whose Sova Centre group monitors anti-extremism measures. \\"It should not be a criminal offense.\\" Hers is not the only such case to generate headlines. A 22-year-old man posted a video of himself playing Pokémon Go in a church in Yekaterinburg after state television warned that such game-playing was a no-no. He, too, was charged under the new law, and has been held since October. No trial dates appear to have been set in either case. (Russia, meanwhile, is decriminalizing domestic violence so long as it only happens once a year.) Expand this summary.","output":"In 2013, Russia enacted a controversial law that criminalizes \\"insulting the feelings of religious believers.\\" Now, a 21-year-old woman faces up to three years in prison for violating this law after posting a photo of herself lighting a cigarette with a candle in a Russian Orthodox church in Belgorod. This law was created in response to the provocative acts of feminist punk group Pussy Riot.  The young woman's case is not the only instance where the law has been enforced. A 22-year-old man was charged under the law after he uploaded a video of himself playing Pokémon Go in a church in Yekaterinburg. The video appeared shortly after state television warned against playing the game in churches. He has been held in custody since October, with no trial date yet announced. Critics argue that while these actions may be considered disrespectful, they should not be deemed criminal offenses. Many view these cases as indicative of the growing tension between the strict adherence to religious traditions and the cultural shift towards a more liberal and secular way of life in Russia. Alexander Verkhovsky, from the Sova Centre group that monitors anti-extremism measures, commented on the woman's case, \\"This is bad behavior, of course, but she should simply have been kicked out of the church. It should not be a criminal offense.\\" Meanwhile, Russia is in the process of decriminalizing some instances of domestic violence, provided the offense does not occur more than once a year. This controversial move has sparked concerns about normalizing abusive behavior and downplaying the severity of domestic violence in the country. As Russia continues to grapple with its position on personal freedoms, religion, and social norms, it remains to be seen how these cases reflect the nation's stance on these issues in the long term. The enforcement of the law against \\"insulting the feelings of religious believers\\" may send a strong message to the public, but it may also alienate those who seek a more liberal and open-minded society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Le droit au respect de la vie privée comporte également la protection de la liberté et du secret des communications sous toutes leurs formes. Translate this to English?","output":"The right to respect for private life also includes the protection of freedom and the secrecy of communications in all their forms. The right to respect for private life is a fundamental concept in many legal systems, which asserts that individuals should be free from undue intrusion into their personal affairs. This concept encompasses a wide range of issues, from physical privacy to informational privacy, and is closely linked to the idea of personal autonomy and dignity. One crucial aspect of the right to respect for private life is the protection of freedom and secrecy of communications. This means that individuals should be able to communicate with one another, whether through verbal conversation, written correspondence, telephone calls, or digital means, without fear that their exchanges will be intercepted, monitored, or disclosed to third parties without their consent. In many countries, such privacy protections have been enshrined in law, either through constitutional provisions or specific legislation. In the United States, for example, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, which has been interpreted to include the interception of private communications. Likewise, the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been ratified by 47 European countries, guarantees the right to respect for private life and correspondence in Article 8. These legal protections recognize that the freedom and secrecy of communications are essential to the functioning of any democratic society. The ability to express thoughts, opinions, and information without fear of intrusion enables citizens to engage in open debate, foster relationships, and seek advice and support from others. In addition, the protection of communications helps to maintain trust between individuals and the organizations they interact with, such as businesses, healthcare providers, and government agencies. In order to preserve these privacy rights, it is important to take steps to safeguard the security and confidentiality of communications in all their forms. This can involve a variety of measures, such as using secure encryption technologies, establishing robust legal frameworks governing the collection, storage, and sharing of personal data, and raising public awareness about privacy risks and best practices. Moreover, as technology continues to evolve and digital communications become increasingly central to daily life, it is essential to continually revisit and update privacy protections to ensure they adequately address new and emerging challenges. This may include, for example, responding to the rise of social media, the proliferation of internet-connected devices, and the increasing capabilities of state surveillance and data mining techniques. In summary, the right to respect for private life, including the protection of freedom and secrecy of communications, is a fundamental aspect of privacy law and personal autonomy. This right is essential to the functioning of democratic societies, and it is crucial to take steps to ensure that it is upheld in the face of continually evolving communication technologies and associated challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It has had to deal with not just the global economic slowdown but also self-inflicted political instability that has seen five prime ministers in three years. That in turn has led to protests at the airports and in the streets. Given all that, Thailand's wealthiest are holding up well and certainly are much better off than they were nine months ago. Together they are worth 25 billion, unchanged since June 2008 when we last looked at net worths of the nation's richest. The set index is still down 9% from that date but is up 82% from its December low. Recovery hasn't been equal across the board. While 13 added to their fortunes, 4 held steady, including Chaleo Yoovidhya, No. 1 for the third year. Among the big gainers are folks whose fortunes are tied to food and agriculture, including Dhanin Chearavanont, who runs one of the world's biggest feed and poultry companies, seafood tycoon Kraisorn Chansiri and sugar barons Nantha Chinthammit of Khon Kaen Sugar Industry and Isara Vongkusolkit of Mitr Phol Sugar. Some, like Dhanin and Isara as well as Krit Ratanarak, also got a boost because of new information. Nineteen are worth less than a year ago including three who make their fortunes in auto parts (see \\"Stalled\\"), a media baron and a hospital entrepreneur. Results were mixed even within certain industries. Consider the diverging fortunes of real estate developers Thongma Vijitpongpun and Anant Asavabhokin. While Thongma's Preuksa rose 15% since last year's list, Anant's Land & Houses slipped 13%. Four newcomers made the cut, including two who took their companies public last year before the markets swooned: Worawit Weeraborwornpong, founder of LPG distributor Siamgas, and Virot Thanalongkorn, head of lingerie firm Sabina. Because the list seeks to include Thailand's most successful businesspeople, longtime Thai resident Aloke Lohia, whose company, Indorama Polymers, is headquartered in Bangkok and has factories in the country, qualifies for the first time, even though he is Indian. A net worth of 85 million was needed to make the ranks, up from last year's 70 million. Four from last year's ranks fell below the cutoff, including Vikrom Kromadit, whose stock in industrial estate developer Amata Corp. dropped 38% since the last list. Public fortunes were calculated using share prices and exchange rates as of Sept. 10. For privately held assets we estimated what they would be worth if public, using information from the Ministry of Commerce Thailand and other sources. This ranking, unlike Forbes' billionaires list, includes numerous family fortunes. Dhanin Chearavanont, for instance, is valued by himself in the billionaire ranks but counted here with his three brothers.

In Turkish, the verb (\\"devam ediyor\\") comes at the end of the sentence.   - \\"With about 1,000 military personnel and 500 police officers\\" translates to \\"Yaklaşık 1.000 askeri personel ve 500 polis memuru ile\\". In Turkish, numbers (\\"1.000\\" and \\"500\\") precede the nouns they refer to (\\"askeri personel\\" and \\"polis memuru\\"). The conjunction \\"and\\" is translated as \\"ve\\". The word \\"ile\\" that comes after the entities signifies 'with'. - \\"Working to clear\\" is interpreted as \\"çalışan\\". In Turkish, the main verb that describes the action comes before the object of the sentence. - \\"The surrounding area\\" translates to \\"çevrenin\\". The possessive form is usually used to signify the object of the action which is to be cleared. - \\"Which is littered with unexploded munitions.\\" is translated as \\"patlamamış mühimmatlarla dolu\\". The relative pronoun \\"which\\" is usually excluded in Turkish, and the description directly follows the noun it modifies. 'Littered with' is translated as 'dolu' where 'patlamamış mühimmatlar' signifies unexploded munitions. It's also worth noting that in Turkish, adjectives normally come before the nouns they modify. Turkish language has a certain flow and structure where the order of words can be different than English. The sentence construction typically flows in a subject-object-verb order and modifiers usually come before the nouns they modify."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: It was one of those terribly hot days in Baltimore. Needless to say, it was too hot to do anything outside. But it was also scorching in our apartment. This was 1962, and I would not live in a place with an air conditioner for another ten years. So my brother and I decided to leave the apartment to find someplace indoors. He suggested we could see a movie. It was a brilliant plan. Movie theaters were one of the few places you could sit all day and--most important --sit in air conditioning. In those days, you could buy one ticket and sit through two movies. Then, the theater would show the same two movies again. If you wanted to, you could sit through them twice. Most people did not do that, but the manager at our theater. Mr. Bellow did not mind if you did. That particular day, my brother and I sat through both movies twice, trying to escape the heat. We bought three bags of popcorn and three sodas each. Then, we sat and watched The Music Man followed by The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. We'd already seen the second movie once before. _ had been at the theater since January, because Mr. Bellow loved anything with John Wayne in it. We left the theater around 8, just before the evening shows began. But we returned the next day and saw the same two movies again, twice more. And we did it the next day too. Finally, on the fourth day, the heat wave broke. Still, to this day I can sing half the songs in The Music Man and recite half of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart's dialogue from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance! Those memories are some of the few I have of the heat wave of 1962. They're really memories of the screen, not memories of my life. Question: What do we know about Mr. Bellow?

Step 2: Analyze event locations - Sentence 1: The event took place in Sudan's Darfur - Sentence 2: The event took place in Abyei Step 3: Evaluate content and location differences - The number of peacekeepers killed differs between the two sentences. - The locations of the events are different, with one being in Darfur and the other in Abyei. Though both locations are within Sudan, they are distinct locations with their own conflict situations.

Her most famous works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928), and the book-length essay A Room of One's Own (1929), with its famous dictum, \\"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\\"Main  body My dear, 'Dearest, I feel certain I am going mad again.

The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  and the situation: Bob is a financial analyst. He used to work for company A. Bob noticed that company A is mostly financed by debt. Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B.

Does \\"Primrose Hill in the northern part of Regent's Park at 256 feet (78 m) is a popular spot to view the city skyline.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"How many royal parks are located in the center of London?\\"","output":"No, the statement \\"Primrose Hill in the northern part of Regent's Park at 256 feet (78 m) is a popular spot to view the city skyline.\\" does not contain the correct answer to \\"How many royal parks are located in the center of London?\\". This statement only refers to Primrose Hill being a popular spot to view the city skyline in the northern part of Regent's Park, without mentioning the number of royal parks in the center of London. To answer the question of how many royal parks are located in the center of London, let's discuss the royal parks present in London. Historically, the Royal Parks of London were owned by the British monarchy and used as hunting grounds by the royal family. Over time, they have been opened to the public and now serve as valuable green spaces in the city.  There are eight Royal Parks in London in total, but we need to identify which ones are located in the center of the city: 1. Green Park: Adjacent to Buckingham Palace, Green Park is located in central London and is one of the city's most famous royal parks. 2. St. James's Park: Also situated in central London, St. James's Park is surrounded by several iconic landmarks, like Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and Whitehall. 3. Regent's Park: This park is located in central-northwest London and is home to various attractions, including the London Zoo and Primrose Hill, as mentioned in the original statement. 4. Kensington Gardens: Although it is situated in western London, Kensington Gardens is still considered part of central London. It is adjacent to Hyde Park and is home to Kensington Palace. 5. Hyde Park: As one of London's most famous parks, Hyde Park is also located in central London and features various monuments, such as the Serpentine Lake and Speaker's Corner. Counting these parks, we see that a total of five Royal Parks are located in the center of London; Green Park, St. James's Park, Regent's Park, Kensington Gardens, and Hyde Park. Other Royal Parks like Richmond Park, Bushy Park, and Greenwich Park are not centrally located and are farther from the city center."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They tour a luxurious, four-story brownstone and are shown, among other things, the master bedroom which houses an interesting commodity: a panic room. Lydia Lynch (Ann Magnuson), the realtor, explains that the previous owner was a reclusive millionaire who built the hidden panic room as a safeguard against intruders. It's protected with four-inch walls and an impressive security system built in complete with a separate phone line and security cameras situated throughout the townhouse. However, despite Sarah's intrigue, Meg is apprehensive about the room. Still, pressured by the tight market and assured that the home will quickly close, Meg decides to move in right away. After some light unpacking and a pizza dinner, they settle in for the night. Meg checks her daughter's watch, designed to track her blood sugar and keep her type 1 diabetes in check, before retreating to her room to bathe and down a bottle of red wine, clearly distraught over the move and her recent divorce. She attempts to wire the phone system in the panic room but gives up and goes to bed as rain falls outside.Later that night, three men break into the house. Junior (Jared Leto), the grandson of the previous owner and Burnham (Forest Whitaker), an employee of the security system with which the panic room was fitted, intend to steal the 3 million in bearer bonds stored in a floor safe inside the panic room. Burnham is distressed to see, however, that Junior has recruited a buddy of his named Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) to assist in the heist. Burnham argues over Raoul's presence, saying that he knows nothing about him and the plan was for just two of them to quietly go in, get the money, and get out.

Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \\"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\\" she probably would have answered, \\"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams   ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled   and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.

Next question: what region of the world is russia in?","output":"Russia, officially known as the Russian Federation, is a complex transcontinental country or Eurasian country spanning two primary regions of the world: Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. Its vast territory covers an area of over 17 million square kilometers, making it the largest country by land area on Earth. Given its enormous size and diverse landscape, Russia can be divided into various subregions based on geographical, historical, and cultural factors. In Eastern Europe, Russia is bordered by countries such as Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland to the northwest, and Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova to the southwest. The eastern European part of Russia consists primarily of the European Plain, a landscape characterized by relatively flat terrain and rich black soil known as chernozem. This region, known as European Russia or Western Russia, is home to the capital city, Moscow, and houses the majority of Russia's population. The Northern Asian portion of Russia, known as Siberia, stretches eastward from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. This vast region, covering approximately two-thirds of Russia's land area, is characterized by extreme climates and challenging geographical features such as the Arctic tundra, Siberian taiga, and mountain ranges such as the Altai, Sayan, and Verkhoyansk. Siberia is sparsely populated compared to the European part of Russia, with large sections of wilderness, natural reserves, and mineral-rich lands. Major Siberian cities include Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Omsk, and Irkutsk. In terms of subregions, Russia can be further divided into more than 80 federal subjects, including republics, oblasts, and autonomous territories. These divisions bring together diverse cultural and ethnic groups falling under the Russian Federation's governance, including Tatars, Bashkirs, Chuvash, Yakuts, and many more. Some key geographical landmarks that exemplify Russia's staggering diversity include Lake Baikal, the world's oldest and deepest freshwater lake, situated in Southern Siberia; the Caspian Sea and Black Sea bordering European Russia; the Volga, Europe's longest river; and Mount Elbrus, the tallest peak in the Caucasus mountain range. In summary, Russia is an immensely vast and multifaceted transcontinental country, occupying portions of both Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. Its unparalleled size, diverse landscapes, and array of cultural and ethnic groups make it a truly unique and fascinating region of the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Prominent Calif. defense attorney and officers arrested in murder of a metal ‘scrapper’ Hunters discovered Korey Kauffman’s body near Yosemite National Park a year after his 2012 disappearance. The 26-year-old Turlock, Calif., man had been known to support his family by “scrapping,” or scavenging metal parts to sell, according to authorities. On Friday, authorities announced arrests in the case, including that of a prominent Modesto, Calif., defense attorney whom Stanislaus County, Calif., Sheriff’s Department investigators described as the ringleader of a conspiracy to kill Kauffman, the Associated Press reported. Three current and former California Highway Patrol officers were also arrested in the case. “This has been a long, three-year investigation into the death and homicide of Korey Kauffman,” Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson said at a news conference. “We hope to serve justice for the Kauffman family.” Frank Clifford Carson, who ran for Stanislaus County district attorney in 2014, was arrested on charges of first-degree murder, false imprisonment, conspiracy and lying in wait. Percy Martinez, Carson’s lawyer, told the AP that his arrest is politically motivated. “We welcome the opportunity to fight this in court,” she said. Carson owned many antiques and vehicles on his property and had grown “frustrated with law enforcement’s response to thefts,” investigators wrote in a 325-page arrest affidavit. Investigators said at a Friday news conference that Carson believed Kauffman and others were stealing his antiques, and so he enlisted the help of two brothers who owned a liquor store in order to send a message, the AP reported. [Can this computer generated image of a ‘Baby Doe’ lead investigators to her identity?] Carson’s wife, Georgia Geanette Defilippo; brothers Baljit Athwal and Daljit Atwal, who spell their names differently; Robert Lee Woody; and former CHP officer Walter Wesley Wells all face first-degree murder charges. Defilippo’s daughter Cristina Anne Defilippo and CHP Officers Scott J. McFarlane and Eduardo Quintanar Jr. were also arrested in the case and face conspiracy charges. “It just kind of rips at the soul of an organization. It’s not what we stand for. It’s so far beyond what any organization stands for,” CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow said at a news conference. “To learn you have employees in an organization like ours, that have some involvement, any involvement or any knowledge of a murder is devastating.” McFarlane and Quintanar Jr. are on administrative leave, Farrow said. Woody had already been incarcerated on charges related to the case. Kauffman’s father, Tony Kauffman, told the Modesto Bee the additional arrests in the case please him, but “it’s only just beginning… We have a long road ahead of us.” Carson has said that any suggestion he’s involved in Kauffman’s death is absurd. Until Friday, officials involved in the investigation had refused to say whether Carson is a suspect in the murder, saying it would be inappropriate to comment on the pending case. As part of the Kauffman investigation, authorities searched Carson’s property not long after Kauffman went missing. Authorities believe Kauffman was killed on March 30, 2012 somewhere in the Turlock area and his body was secretly transported to Mariposa County where hunters discovered it in August 2013. According to the affidavit, Kauffman went missing after he planned to steal irrigation pipes stacked on Carson’s property.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article:Researchers from several countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the UK, tracked 1,900 people, aged between 14 and 24, over a 10-year period. BBC News website readers from around the world have been getting in touch with their views on these latest findings linked to the controversial drug. You will find that any data supposedly \\"proving\\" that cannabis use leads to schizophrenia or psychosis are of the \\"cherry picked\\" variety. The prohibitionist lobby have been playing this card every few years since the 1920s and, even if it were true, this would be another strong reason why cannabis possession and supply should be legal and regulated, so that quality and supply could be monitored and use by young children eliminated. I'm now 49-years-old and have been taking cannabis for more than 30 years. If I can find a good, clean source, then I won't turn it down. I started taking it as a teenager for pain relief. I had undergone a traumatic episode in my life and suffered extreme muscle damage. My friends told me it was good medically, so I thought it might help me. I'm not addicted though. I don't climb the walls if I don't get any. I have a great interest in cannabis and have tried to carry out as much research as possible into the scientific facts surrounding it without being influenced by the pro or anti lobby. I have had negative effects but only when I have taken doctored cannabis, which has been mixed with things like horse tranquiliser. That is why I try to only use the pure stuff. When I saw this study, my first reaction was \\"oh god\\". If you have any mental illness and you use drugs and alcohol, then it is likely to have an effect, but to say it causes psychosis - that's wrong. I don't drink but I do take cannabis, however, I would tell children not to dabble - in the same way they shouldn't with other substances. I smoked cannabis a couple of times when I was 24-years-old. I used to hang around with some people who regularly took it. I used to work with my father and my brother in the butchery business but after I started taking cannabis I started showing signs of psychosis. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and had to spend some time in hospital. I'm now 55-years-old and those few drags I took when I was younger definitely changed my life and made it go rapidly downhill. I directly attribute my illness to the cannabis. After I started taking it, I asked my mum at the family business if I could have a holiday as I'd been working rather hard, it was then I started hearing voices and became delusional. My mum went to the doctor who asked me if I wanted to go into hospital. Initially I declined but about a month later, I agreed. I've now been on medication for most of my life and would advise people not to dabble in cannabis. I am fine now, but I am dead against the thought of taking anything that's harmful to the body. I have worked as a drug advisor in the educational field for more than 20 years and the rubbish spouted about cannabis needs to stop. Cannabis, like all psychoactive substances, will act as a catalyst for any pre disposition to a psychiatric or psychotic episode. As it is usually taken in conjunction with other drugs especially alcohol, it cannot be easily concluded that cannabis alone is the culprit. The fact that it remains illegal is probably a more relevant indicator as to why it is singled out. People with a dual diagnosis - who have mental illnesses and take cannabis - how can you distinguish which one they got first? In my own personal experiences, I know about four or five people who had \\"cannabis-related episodes\\" but they were also drinking at the time - so it was difficult to say what caused or contributed  to it. Each person is different, and the way psychoactive substances affect people also varies. The other thing is that cannabis can sometimes help mental and physical problems. It can benefit certain types of auto-immune diseases. I'm not pro or anti, but think these studies need to be considered in context. I smoked cannabis for approximately 25 years and towards the end I felt like I was hanging onto sanity by my fingernails. Some of the worse symptoms included voices in the night, a constant dread of death, suicidal thoughts and intense mood swings. I never thought I would kick the habit until one day I was attacked by someone out side a supermarket due to my psychotic ramblings. This person probably saved my life or a least my sanity. Dominic, Luton, UK I have been a user of of cannabis for the past 17 years and it has never stopped me from building a good professional career with qualifications and a senior post within a large multi national organisation. I think people forget that these studies can be easily directed at similar \\"drugs\\" like alcohol and cigarettes which although are publicised as being bad for your health are completely legal. It's easy to turn around and blame someone's personal failures in life on the fact they smoke cannabis, but in reality the person probably already suffers from some form of psychosis or is plain lazy to begin with. We should stop using this as an excuse and do the right thing which is to decriminalize cannabis, this would make it much safer for the millions of people that use it recreationally. Beavis, Birmingham, UK I spent many years playing in bands in an environment where cannabis use is pretty much the norm. All it ever did for me was send me to sleep. My observation, for what it's worth: if you're not paranoid when you start smoking dope, you sure will be after you've been at it for a couple of years. David Ballantyne, Raleigh, US I spent my student years smoking pot and thinking it was not only harmless but it made me more creative (if anything it made me more lazy). But then I gave up as I realised you can't lead a successful life and smoke cannabis. But for years I believed that it was non-addictive and should be legalised. Now I work for a rehab clinic and have been doing some research into drugs. I still believe it's not addictive but I was told by people working in rehab that about 10% of dope smokers end up with psychosis, and one expert I spoke to in London said that \\"cannabis is the drug that creates the most problems for psychiatrists\\". Rupert Wolfe Murray, Bucharest, Romania I blame my son's suicide at the age 19 on cannabis use, he used it from the age of 14. I believe that cannabis use affected him badly, causing erratic behaviour and subsequent mental illness. Janine Gray, Caloundra, Australia Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article presents a compilation of personal experiences and opinions on cannabis use from various individuals around the world. The main points discussed in the article include: 1. Some individuals believe that the data suggesting cannabis leads to schizophrenia or psychosis may be \\"cherry-picked,\\" and argue for cannabis regulation to control quality and supply. 2. A few respondents share their experience using cannabis for its potential medical benefits, noting that negative effects may be more associated with impure or \\"doctored\\" cannabis. 3. Others argue against the notion that cannabis is the sole cause of psychotic episodes, stressing the need to consider other factors, such as alcohol consumption and pre-existing mental conditions. 4. Some of the contributors highlight that not all cannabis users experience mental health issues or complications in their professional life, implying that cannabis use may affect individuals differently. 5. While a couple of people share their negative experiences with cannabis, either through anecdotal observations or personal struggles, not all the respondents are strictly \\"anti-cannabis.\\" Many contributors emphasize the need for contextualization and further research into the subject."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Decision-thinking is not unlike poker --it often matters not only what you think, but also what others think you think and what you think they think you think.The mental process is similar.Naturally,this card game has often been of considerable interest to people who are,by any standards,good thinkers. The great mathematician John von Neumann was one of the founders of game theory.In particular,he showed that all games fall into two classes:there are what he called games of  'perfect information', games like chess where the players can't hide anything or play tricks:they don't win by chance,but by means of logic and skills.Then there are games of 'imperfect information', 1ike poker,in which it is impossible to know in advance that one course of action is better than another. One mistaken idea about business is that it can be treated as a game of perfect information.Quite the reverse.Business,politics,life itself are games which we must normally play with very imperfect information.Business decisions are often made with many unknown and unknowable factors which would even puzzle best poker players.But few business people find it comfortable to admit that they are taking a chance,and many still prefer to believe that they are playing chess,not poker.

Article:","output":"Title: How to Make a Simple Fly Trap Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to learn how to make a super-duper easy fly trap to help keep pesky flies away from our home and garden. Let's get started! Step 1: Find a Small Container First, we need a small container for our fly trap. This can be something like an empty yoghurt container or a small jar. Make sure it's clean! Step 2: Add Vinegar Now, we need to add some vinegar to our container. Vinegar is a special liquid that flies really like, so it will help us catch them. Fill the container about halfway with vinegar. Ask a grown-up to help you if you need it! Step 3: Add Dish Soap Next, we are going to add a little bit of dish soap to the vinegar. This will make it hard for the flies to escape once they get inside our trap. Just a few drops will do the trick! Step 4: Add Fruit or Raw Meat Now, we need to put something in our trap that flies really love to eat. Some good choices are small pieces of fruit or raw meat. Pop these inside the container with the vinegar and dish soap. Step 5: Cover the Container with Plastic Wrap Next, we need to cover our container with some plastic wrap. This will keep the flies from flying away once they get inside. Make sure it's stretched tight and cover the entire opening. Step 6: Poke Holes in the Plastic Wrap Ask a grown-up to help you poke some small holes in the plastic wrap. This will let the flies crawl inside our trap, but they'll have a hard time getting back out. Step 7: Place the Trap Outside Find a good spot to place your trap, usually near where you see lots of flies. Put the trap outside so the flies can find it and crawl inside. Step 8: Say Goodbye to Flies After a day or two, you should start to see lots of flies trapped inside your container. That means our trap is working! Give yourself a high five! Step 9: Throw Out the Dead Flies Once the trap is full of flies, it's time to throw them away. Ask a grown-up to help you take the plastic wrap off and pour the dead flies into the trash. Step 10: Clean Your Container Finally, it's important to clean your container so it's ready to use again. A grown-up can help you wash it out with soapy water and make sure it's all clean and disinfected. That's it! You've made your very own simple fly trap. Now, you can have a fly-free home and garden with your handy dandy trap. Great job!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: As culture secretary, John Whittingdale's job is to regulate newspapers and he is currently overseeing a whole new regulatory framework under consideration in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. In 2011, it emerged that thousands of people, from celebrities to families of murder victims, had been victims of phone hacking by the now-defunct News of the World. In response, Prime Minister David Cameron set up a public, judge-led investigation - the Leveson Inquiry - to examine the culture, behaviour and ethics of the press. After hearing from numerous high-profile witnesses, Lord Leveson recommended newspapers should continue to be self-regulated - as they had been by the Press Complaints Commission - but that there should be a new press standards body created by the industry, backed by legislation, and with a new code of conduct. The inquiry specifically focussed on the press, not into the media more generally. Broadcasters are regulated by Ofcom, which is backed by law. In 2013, the then main political party leaders, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, agreed to set up a new press watchdog by Royal Charter. It would have the power to impose million-pound fines on UK publishers and demand prominent corrections and apologies from UK news publishers, they said. Newspapers who refused to join the new regulatory regime would be liable - potentially - for hefty damages if a claim was upheld against them. The press kicked back, saying the final draft of the Royal Charter plan was neither \\"voluntary or independent\\", and formed its own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), with wider powers than previous bodies. David Cameron - uncomfortable with the idea of state interference in the press - rejected the idea of legislation to underpin the new system of regulation. The compromise was the Royal Charter - an unlikely way to regulate the press. It is often described as a medieval form of documentation, used to set up universities. The Royal Charter itself mainly sets out the workings of the body that is supposed to guarantee the self-regulator does its job properly. But despite what one paper called its \\"flummery\\" the government spotted advantages to a Royal Charter. While an act of parliament can be amended with a simple majority, it was possible to insert a clause in the Royal Charter requiring any changes to be approved by a two-thirds majority. Campaigners tentatively welcomed the Royal Charter plan, saying it would protect the public against the worst abuses of the press. However, the newspaper industry raised concerns that it would give politicians too much power. The Newspaper Society said it was tantamount to \\"state-sponsored regulation\\". The Royal Charter was approved by the Queen in October 2013. However, publishers have largely chosen not to sign up to the voluntary system, sticking instead with their own regulator Ipso. A key part of the Royal Charter plan was a law requiring publishers to pay both sides' costs in a privacy or libel case, even if they won - unless they signed up to the official press regulator. This has been passed by Parliament - as section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 - but still needs to be signed off by Culture Secretary John Whittingdale. Victims of press intrusion have accused the government of breaking its promise over regulation. Mr Whittingdale says it is \\"under consideration\\" and has told newspaper editors he questions whether this legal change will be \\"positive\\" for the newspaper industry. Labour's Maria Eagle says Mr Whittingdale must \\"clarify exactly why he no longer believes\\" section 40 of the act should come into force. Labour has now also called for Mr Whittingdale to withdraw from press regulation decisions after it emerged four newspapers were aware of his past relationship with a sex worker, but did not run the story. While the first part of the Leveson Inquiry has finished, a second stage looking at the relationship between the press and the police is yet to come. It was put on hold until all criminal and legal proceedings linked to the phone-hacking scandal were completed - although there have been suggestions that it may be shelved altogether. The major phone-hacking trials of News International journalists concluded in 2014. Labour has demanded the second stage goes ahead, but Downing Street says no decision has yet been taken about whether to continue with the inquiry. According to a House of Lords report, the first stage of Leveson cost Â£5.4m. Summary:","output":"A man named John Whittingdale has a job where he helps make sure newspapers follow the rules. After some newspapers caused problems by listening in on people's phone calls, a big meeting called the Leveson Inquiry talked about what to do. They decided to make new rules for newspapers, but some people thought the rules were too bossy. So, the newspapers made their own group called \\"Ipso\\" to follow the rules in their own way. Meanwhile, the government is still thinking about signing off on the new rules to make them official, but hasn't done it yet. Some people really want those new rules, but other people aren't so sure. They are still trying to figure out the best thing to do for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article: With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.

Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: In October 1992, an elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Yu and Lee suspect a leak, as they are always one step too slow. Hee is ordered to eliminate the 'kissing gourami' obstacle. Yu meets with Police... A:","output":"In the context of the film Shiri, the \\"kissing gourami\\" obstacle which Lee is ordered to eliminate refers symbolically to agent Yu Jong-won. Yu Jong-won, the protagonist, is trying to unravel the plot behind the assassinations and the theft of a dangerous substance called CTX. He was given a pair of kissing gourami by his fiancée, Yi Myung-hyun. In the plot of the film, kissing gourami are depicted as a species that cannot live without their mate, symbolising the bond that Yu has with his fiancée, Yi Myung-hyun. The phrase \\"kissing gourami\\" obstacle presumably refers to Yu, as he is the one standing in the way of the North Korean agents' plans. They see him as the main obstacle that needs to be eliminated for their mission to succeed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: What does Aubrey need to do before this?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: take more breaks  B: lose track of time  C: ask for a paycheck Answer:","output":"According to the given context, the best answer to the question \\"What does Aubrey need to do before this?\\" would be B: lose track of time.  In the situation described, Aubrey gave Carson a break at work and took more time than they were supposed to. This implies that Aubrey might have lost track of time, which caused them to take longer than intended. This is because in order for Aubrey to take more time than they were supposed to, they would likely have been unaware of how much time had passed. Option A, \\"take more breaks,\\" does not seem relevant to the context provided, as it does not explain why Aubrey would have taken more time than they were supposed to. Furthermore, it seems unrelated to the main point of the situation as taking more breaks would not directly impact the specific incident described. Option C, \\"ask for a paycheck,\\" is also irrelevant to the context of the situation. Asking for a paycheck would not be a necessary step before giving Carson a break, nor would it provide any explanation as to why Aubrey took more time than they were supposed to during the break. This option does not relate specifically to the incident or contribute to understanding the context provided. Therefore, based on the context given, the answer that best answers the question of what Aubrey needs to do before taking more time than they were supposed to is B: lose track of time."},{"instruction":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What needs to be done before the final step?\\" is in \\"In the United States, new pharmaceutical products must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as being both safe and effective.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am...

Last week, the Olympics minister Tessa Jowell announced a public competition to design a typically British garden within London's new Olympic park. Jowell said the idea behind the competition was to show off to the world one of the nation's favorite hobbies. It's likely the government also hopes that the competition will inspire more Brits to take an interest in the Olympics. It's a good plan, as the British love gardens almost as much as they love tea.     In many ways gardening defines Brits, perhaps because they are some of the world's keenest gardeners. The garden is seen as a private place in the UK. Most Brits would far rather sit in their garden than visit a park. They see their garden as an extension of their house outdoors, which is why so many Brits are as garden-proud as they are house-proud. There also seems to be something about the nourishing  act of gardening that appeals to the nation's gentle temperament . Interestingly, gardening has never been as widely enjoyed as it is today in Britain. Its growing popularity is no doubt due to people's increased awareness of the environment and the success of several popular gardening programs. Historically, Brits are also skilful gardeners. As Jowell noted when she made her announcement, if gardening were an Olympic sport then green-fingered Brits \\"would win gold, silver and bronze.\\" Of course, the irony  of Brits' passion for gardening is that their climate is so wet that there are very few months in the year they can sit outside and enjoy their gardens. In fact, it may be the very valuableness of these few warm months that make gardens so prized and valued by Brits. Question: What can we know from the passage? - Brits love gardening as much as before. - Brits love their gardens more than they love their houses. - Brits are known to love gardening as much as they love tea. - Brits enjoy sitting in their gardens as much as sitting in the park. The answer is:","output":"Brits are known to love gardening as much as they love tea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under is Nikisch. It is mentioned that Monteux modelled his orchestral conducting technique on that of Arthur Nikisch. Thus, the surname 'Nikisch' corresponds to the conductor who influenced Monteux's style and approaches."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Question: \\"Which of the following is not a use of flight: feeding, breeding, or a lightweight skeleton?\\"  Context: \\"Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"A lightweight skeleton is not a use of flight. In the context provided, flight is primarily used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape.

Mr Assad accused the West of making up events in Khan Sheikhoun so it had an excuse to carry out missile strikes on the government's Shayrat airbase, which took place a few days after the alleged attack. \\"It's stage one, the play [they staged] that we saw on social network and TVs, then propaganda and then stage two, the military attack,\\" he told the AFP, questioning the authenticity of the video footage. Mr Assad also said the Syrian government had given up its chemical arsenal in 2013, adding \\"even if we have them, we wouldn't use them\\". Since 2013, there have been continued allegations that chemicals such as chlorine and ammonia have been used against civilians, by both the Syrian government and rebel groups. Turkey and the UK say tests show Sarin or a Sarin-like substance was used in Khan Sheikhoun, which would be the first time since 2013 that a prohibited chemical had been used on such a scale. President Assad's flat denial that his country has used chemical weapons and that last week's incident was a fabrication concocted by al-Qaeda and Washington does not square with the \\"case for the prosecution\\". Indeed it sits uneasily with the Russian version of events which says that a rebel warehouse was hit by a bomb from a Syrian warplane thus releasing the chemical agent. President Assad's denials must contend with the fact that samples from some of the victims were analysed in Turkey and the results indicated a Sarin-like agent was used. Then there is the detailed narrative, provided by the Americans who tracked the aircraft they say launched the attack, from its base, to the target location, and then home again. There are too the many videos that were released immediately after the attack showing the victims. Their timing and location have been verified by independent researchers. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday it was \\"highly likely\\" the Assad regime was behind the attack. \\"Apart from anything else, we believe it's the only regime that has the capability to make such an attack,\\" she added. Turkey, which treated many of the wounded, says it has \\"concrete evidence\\" Sarin was used. The US, UK and France reacted angrily on Wednesday after Russia, Syria's key ally, vetoed a draft UN resolution condemning the alleged chemical attack. It is the eighth time Russia has cast a veto at the UN Security Council over the Syrian conflict. However, both the Turkish and Russian leaders have agreed, in a telephone conversation, to support the OPCW investigation. Mr Assad told AFP that he would only allow an \\"impartial\\" investigation, involving \\"unbiased countries... to make sure that they won't use it for politicised purposes. The US had, until its Shayrat attack, limited its involvement in Syria to removing the so-called Islamic State (IS) from its stronghold in the city of Raqqa. The Pentagon admitted on Thursday that it accidentally killed 18 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces, its ally in the fight against IS, in an airstrike on Monday, just south of the town of Tabqa, some 40km (25 miles) from Raqqa. More than 300,000 people have lost their lives and millions of people have been displaced since a peaceful uprising against Mr Assad six years ago turned into a full-scale civil war. This article was about:","output":"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has claimed that the alleged chemical attack that took place in the town of Khan Sheikhoun on April 4, 2017, killing over 80 people, was a fabrication orchestrated by the West. In an exclusive video interview with the AFP news agency, he argued that the attack was staged as a pretext for the United States to launch missile strikes on the government's Shayrat airbase a few days later. Assad also mentioned that his government gave up its chemical arsenal in 2013 and that even if they still possessed it, they wouldn't use it. This statement faced immediate criticism as it contradicted Russia's version of events. Russia claimed that a rebel warehouse containing chemical munitions was hit by a bomb from a Syrian warplane, thus releasing the chemical agent. Assad's denial has to contend with evidence from Turkey and the United Kingdom which shows that the nerve agent Sarin or a Sarin-like substance was used in the attack. Furthermore, the United States provided a detailed narrative of the aircraft's route from its base to the target area in Khan Sheikhoun and its return. UK Prime Minister Theresa May stated that it was \\"highly likely\\" that the Assad regime was responsible for the attack, citing the fact that it was the only regime with the capability of executing such an attack. Turkey, which treated many of the victims, says that it has \\"concrete evidence\\" that Sarin was used in the town. While Russia vetoed a draft UN resolution condemning the alleged chemical attack, leaders from both Russia and Turkey have agreed to support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) investigation. President Assad mentioned that he would only allow an \\"impartial\\" investigation involving \\"unbiased countries\\" to ensure that no political motives influenced the results. This disagreement over the alleged chemical attack has heightened tensions between the countries involved and further complicated an already volatile situation in Syria. Over 300,000 people have lost their lives, and millions have been displaced since the conflict began six years ago."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first town in England to be given county status? ?  Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries. Answer:","output":"The first town in England to be given county status was Bristol in 1373."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vilkas liikenne ja sen tuomat vaarat ovat ongelmia, joihin kiinnitämme ensisijaista huomiota. Translate this to English?","output":"\\"Heavy traffic and the dangers it brings are problems that we prioritize.\\" The Finnish phrase \\"Vilkas liikenne ja sen tuomat vaarat ovat ongelmia, joihin kiinnitämme ensisijaista huomiota\\" translates to English as the sentence above. The phrase emphasizes the focus on addressing the issues caused by heavy traffic and the various hazards that arise as a consequence. In this context, it implies the need for more attention and planning to make roads safer, reduce congestion, and improve transportation systems for a better and more efficient driving experience.  Heavy traffic and its hazards can lead to numerous problems, such as increased risk of accidents, pollution caused by vehicle emissions, noise, and time wasted due to delays and inefficiencies. These issues have a significant impact on public health, productivity, and overall quality of life.  To combat these issues, various measures can be taken in urban planning, infrastructure, and transportation policies. This includes: 1. Developing an efficient public transportation system: When people have access to reliable and quick forms of public transportation, there is a reduced need to rely on private vehicles, which reduces traffic congestion. 2. Encouraging the use of alternative transportation modes: Promoting cycling, walking, or carpooling offers an opportunity to decrease the number of cars on the road and lessen traffic issues. 3. Implementing intelligent traffic management systems: Utilizing AI and data technologies in traffic management can significantly improve the flow of traffic and increase road network efficiency. 4. Road infrastructure improvements: Expanding the capacity of existing roads, constructing new road networks, and maintaining the road system properly helps alleviate congestion and potential hazards. 5. Implementing congestion pricing: Introducing fees for using heavily congested roads during peak times can incentivize people to travel during less busy times or use alternative routes. 6. Adopting policy changes to promote sustainable transportation modes: This includes incentivizing electric vehicles, promoting car-sharing programs, or providing tax benefits for using public transport. 7. Raising awareness about the impacts of heavy traffic: Educating the public on the dangers and drawbacks of heavy traffic can encourage more responsible behavior and promote safer roadways overall. In conclusion, prioritizing the issue of heavy traffic and the dangers it brings helps communities, urban planners, and policymakers to implement strategies that not only address traffic-related problems but also promote sustainable and equitable transportation systems. The resulting improvements can contribute to a higher quality of life, better health outcomes, and a more efficient use of resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie begins in an Eastern Orthodox church in Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina, when an unidentified man (later revealed to be a Bosnian diplomat to the UN) is murdered in an alley after receiving a page to meet someone outside.The scene then immediately shifts to a missile base in Chelyabinsk, Russia, where SS-18 ICBM's are being decommissioned. Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide. The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity. The explosion immediately garners the attention of the US government.Even though the detonation was staged to look like an accident, White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly (Kidman) is not convinced: SS-18 warheads can only be detonated deliberately. She believes that terrorists are behind the incident. Her newly assigned military liaison disagrees with her. He is smooth-talking and irreverent US Army Special Forces officer Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe (Clooney), and he is convinced that the crash and the detonation were both staged, to hide the hijacking of the other warheads on board. A call to Devoe's long time friend and Russian counterpart, Dmitri Vertekoff (Armin Mueller-Stahl), adds credence to his hypothesis.Kelly and Devoe try to track down the terrorists through an Austrian trucking company which is a front for the Russian Mafia.

Doing so could cost him his job waiting for him in Chicago; nevertheless, he wants to try his luck for the last time before passing the age limit to compete.The competition for a financial grant and two years of concert engagements pits the intense and arrogant Paul against a select group of talented artists. He advances to the final round of six, which includes a brash New Yorker named Jerry DiSalvo, who only knows how to play one concerto, Michael Humphries, who rehearses in the nude, Canadian pianist, Mark Landau, who is note-perfect but emotionally moribund, and a meek Russian girl, Tatjana Baronova, whose teacher disrupts the competition by defecting to the United States.Another contestant, Heidi Joan Schoonover, is a young American who developed a romantic inclination toward Paul after meeting him at a music festival.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. \\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. Question: Why did experts pay little attention to the problem of Atlantis? Options: A: Because it worked perfectly. B: Because the right booster was still OK. C: Because nothing serious happened then. D: Because fewer people died in the flight.

Australia begins to question the value of continuing as an outpost to the British Empire. Since his sister's death years ago, Jack Dickens has raised his niece Sally, aided by his sharp-tongued maid Hannah. Sally's father, Alexander Voysey, abandoned her after her mother's death and took off for the bright lights of the city, ostensibly making a name for himself as a literary critic and writer in London. Jack and Sally have sacrificed their own hopes and dreams to run the farm while Voysey disports himself in the city. Despite the claims of success, Voysey is a self-centered, self-aggrandizing, pompous windbag with no visible means of support beyond leeching off his brother-in-law's labor on the farm. Voysey has remarried a younger woman, Deborah, who has come to regret her marriage. Voysey subjects Deborah to cruel behavior from him, such as fetching things he's dropped at his whim and making advances to other women right in front of her. Deborah is deeply unhappy, and feels that she has wasted her youth and squandered her life in marrying Voysey.

Question: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

Bill Clinton makes speaking debut on 2016 campaign trail In a speech at the Nashua Community College in New Hampshire, Clinton told stories about the early days of their relationship. \\"I thought she was the most amazing person,\\" he said, describing the two meeting and falling in love nearly 45 years ago. \\"Everything she touched, she made better,\\" he said. Clinton's understated speech marked the beginning of what is expected to be a month-long drive to help his wife win the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. Though Hillary Clinton officially entered the presidential race in April 2015, her husband hasn't yet had a speaking role. Instead, he has mostly offered advice and helped fundraise behind the scenes. His decision to return to the campaign trail in New Hampshire is notable because that's where Clinton is fending off a challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders, who represents neighboring Vermont. Bill Clinton on the trail: The good, the bad and the ugly Bill Clinton joked that he is out of place on the campaign trail in the current political climate. \\"I don't fit anymore,\\" he said. \\"First of all, I'm a happy grandfather. I'm not mad at anybody.\\" The former president, who President Barack Obama has dubbed the explainer-in-chief, was a controversial figure in Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign -- when exit polls showed that particularly in states like South Carolina, his negative attacks on then-Sen. Obama could have had a net negative effect. In this campaign, Bill Clinton said, Hillary Clinton is pursuing \\"politics that are inclusive enough to actually get something done.\\" \\"I think this election is about restoring broadly shared prosperity, rebuilding the middle class,\\" Clinton said. Clinton didn't take shots at Republican presidential candidates by name -- though he did say that the field is \\"kind of scary.\\" He said his wife once excitedly came home explaining how she'd found a human side of Tom DeLay, the former House Republican leader and nemesis of Democrats whom she'd discovered was also an adoptive parent. Monday's nearly 30-minute speech came in front of an audience of about 720 people in the community college's gym, according to Nashua's fire marshal. Clinton's arrival is not a guaranteed success, and Republicans -- including Chris Christie who was also in New Hampshire Monday -- attacked Clinton as \\"going backward.\\" And GOP front-runner Donald Trump has recently revived Clinton's past scandals -- including Monica Lewinsky -- as a way to attack the Clintons.

On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design.

At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies. Pedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla.

Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth. The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom \\"Servo\\" Harrison. Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the Star Wars pants game. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school. He claims the only downside to the job is the trekkies—specifically, two irate, Star Wars-hating ones named James and Stewart.

While waiting for Tom to get their new Star Trek cards, Stewart accidentally spills soda on a set of comics that Greg's boss ordered.

Tom realizes that they can sell the undamaged books to Greg's boss for full price and pocket the money from the Trekkies. At Greg's suggestion, Tom combines the money with his remaining store credit and buys model lightsabers, which prompts the idea in his mind of making a Star Wars fanfilm.","output":"The two people who begin a duel on a forest planet are Jacen Solo, played by Gregory, and Darth Katai, played by Zarth."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question.

Steve Borden, the man she is involved with, calls her on the phone (though he is also in the terminal) and tells her to buy a ticket to San Francisco. Afterward, she sees him with another woman. They board the bus too. Norman, who is supposed to go to San Francisco by train, decides to travel by bus instead. Murphy has orders from Norman's father to keep him away from women. To Murphy's satisfaction, Sue rebuffs Norman's initial attempts to become better acquainted. May gives all her money to a friend, but manages to charm the bus driver, various relief drivers and Willy, a talkative, know-it-all passenger, into letting her ride for free. When the bus stops in Poughkeepsie, Steve and Nita Borden prove to be con artists, selling bibles at inflated prices to those who have lost loved ones recently, claiming they were specially ordered by the deceased. Nita, suspecting what is going on, later chats with Sue and introduces her husband, Steve. A disgusted Sue breaks up with Steve. She then makes a date with the persistent Norman at Niagara Falls.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: FCO Faces Criticism Over Mishandling of Victim Assistance: A Deeper Look at the Incident and the Ensuing Investigation Introduction The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has recently come under fire as an investigation exposed the inadequacy of their response after a woman was attacked while abroad. The lack of proper assistance, including failing to provide concise explanations or relevant support, as well as neglecting to offer medical examination or hospital accompaniment, has led to the organization being found guilty of both maladministration and injustice. This article delves deeper into the details surrounding the case, the investigation, and the implications of these revelations for the FCO's reputation and operations. The Incident An unnamed woman, presumably a British citizen, encountered a distressing encounter while abroad as she became the victim of a brutal assault. In the aftermath of the attack, the traumatized woman sought help from the FCO, as it is in their purview to provide necessary assistance to British nationals who find themselves in perilous situations during their travels. The FCO's Response The officials tasked with handling the victim's plea for help fell short of their responsibilities, failing to provide clear explanations on how they could render aid. They neglected to offer a medical examination, which could reveal vital information pertinent to the case and contribute to the survivor's healing. Furthermore, the FCO officials did not offer to accompany the woman to the hospital, leaving her to face an uncertain and daunting experience alone.  Investigation and Findings Following the victim's report of the FCO's unsatisfactory response, an investigation was launched to examine the conduct of the concerned officials. Upon its conclusion, the investigatory committee unequivocally found the FCO guilty of maladministration and injustice, highlighting their gross mismanagement of a critical situation involving an individual in dire need. While officials are trained to handle a variety of contingencies faced by Britons overseas, it is clear that a disconnect exists between their institutional guidelines and their applicability in practice. Implications for the FCO This unfortunate incident exposes the FCO's shortcomings in rendering essential auxiliary services to British citizens abroad. It threatens to undermine the credibility of the institution, which prides itself on providing guidance and support to individuals in need. As a result, the FCO faces calls for accountability, thorough review of their existing protocols and practices, as well as the implementation of comprehensive reforms to ensure that such incidents do not reoccur.  Moving Forward For the FCO, this case serves as a clarion call to reassess and redouble their efforts in providing proper assistance to British nationals who rely on their services during tumultuous times. Moreover, it emphasizes the urgent need for a cultural shift within the organization, fostering greater empathy and understanding in their dealings with trauma-stricken individuals. Conclusion In conclusion, the case of the inadequately assisted woman highlights that even well-established institutions like the FCO are vulnerable to lapses in proper care. The findings of maladministration and injustice serve as a sobering reminder for the FCO to revisit their support services and protocols, ensuring that they are not only robust on paper but also genuinely effective in action. Ultimately, for the sake of those who may one day need its aid, it is crucial that the FCO uses this opportunity to learn from its mistakes and renew its commitment to the protection and well-being of British nationals around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

MOHUN APPEARS FOR THE LAST TIME IN THIS HISTORY.  Besides my Lord Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, who for family reasons had kindly promised his protection and patronage to Colonel Esmond, he had other great friends in power now, both able and willing to assist him, and he might, with such allies, look forward to as fortunate advancement in civil life at home as he had got rapid promotion abroad. His Grace was magnanimous enough to offer to take Mr. Esmond as secretary on his Paris embassy, but no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected; at any rate, Esmond could not bear the thoughts of attending his mistress farther than the church-door after her marriage, and so declined that offer which his generous rival made him.  Other gentlemen in power were liberal at least of compliments and promises to Colonel Esmond. Mr. Harley, now become my Lord Oxford and Mortimer, and installed Knight of the Garter on the same day as his Grace of Hamilton had received the same honor, sent to the Colonel to say that a seat in Parliament should be at his disposal presently, and Mr. St. John held out many flattering hopes of advancement to the Colonel when he should enter the House. Esmond's friends were all successful, and the most successful and triumphant of all was his dear old commander, General Webb, who was now appointed Lieutenant-General of the Land Forces, and received with particular honor by the Ministry, by the Queen, and the people out of doors, who huzza'd the brave chief when they used to see him in his chariot going to the House or to the Drawing-room, or hobbling on foot to his coach from St. Stephen's upon his glorious old crutch and stick, and cheered him as loud as they had ever done Marlborough.  Answer the following questions: 1. Where do you think this takes place? 2. Did Colonel Esmond have friends in high places? 3. Who promised to protect Esmond? 4. What position was Esmond offered? 5. Where would that have taken place? 6. Was His Grace certain Esmond would accept the offer? 7. Why did Esmond not accept? Numbered answers:","output":"1. Based on the characters' titles and the mention of significant places like St. Stephen's and the Drawing-room, this situation likely takes place in England. 2.

Article:","output":"Title: Fort Worth City Contractors Admit Devastating Blunder in Demolition of Wrong House Introduction: A tragic mistake was made by city contractors in Fort Worth, Texas, when they accidentally demolished the wrong house, a property cherished by the Underwood family, according to recent reports. Body: Fort Worth city contractors have admitted to a severe blunder in accidentally demolishing the wrong house. David Underwood and his wife intended to move into their Texas property, 9716 Watercress Drive, which had been in his family for decades. However, when the couple arrived at the site, they were shocked to find that their treasured family home had been destroyed. The demolition team was initially contracted to knock down a house located at 9708 Watercress Drive. However, the contractors mistakenly ended up demolishing the Underwood family's home at 9716 Watercress Drive. The mistake was only realized after the demolition was complete. According to Fort Worth officials, the error occurred due to a failure in communication between the contractors and the city. Representatives have reassured the public that steps are being taken to prevent such errors in the future, including double-checking addresses before proceeding with demolition projects. The Underwood family is left with the heartbreak of losing their cherished family home, which they had planned to occupy in the coming months. David Underwood said in an interview that the situation feels like a terrible dream he cannot wake up from. He added that the house had numerous memories and valuable items that are now lost forever. Conclusion: Fort Worth city contractors' devastating blunder has highlighted the significance of clear communication between government agencies and independent contractors. As the Underwood family deals with the aftermath of this unfortunate error, the city is working to implement safeguards to avoid such mistakes in the future. The fact remains that no amount of precaution can ever replace the loss experienced by the Underwoods, but hopefully, their story will serve as a cautionary tale and prevent similar incidents from occurring as a sobering reminder of the cost of errors in such situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. What is probably true about the relationship between US and Canada after Trump met with Canada's leader?

Answer the following question: Process:  - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animals die in soft mud more often happens, how will it affect more sediment builds up over the remains.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if animals die in soft mud more often, it would affect the rate at which sediment builds up over the remains. This increased frequency of animals dying in soft mud could indeed have a direct effect on the fossilization process. Since more animals and plants are dying in soft soil or mud, there would be an increased availability of remains for the sediment to accumulate over. This could lead to a faster rate of sediment buildup, as more remains would be present in the environment. Additionally, it could potentially lead to a higher probability of fossil formation, as more organic material would be available for the fossilization process to occur. Although the perturbation hypothesis presents a direct effect on the sediment buildup and potential fossil formation, it is important to note that other factors such as decomposition, mineral replacement, and the environment could also play a role in the overall process of fossilization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A tourist asking a local for directions to their hotel.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A person asks directions.\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"A person asks directions\\" in the situation of \\"A tourist asking a local for directions to their hotel.\\" Let's break down the components of the original statement to better understand the connection and infer the conclusion. 1. A tourist: This refers to a person who is visiting a place for pleasure or traveling to a destination outside their usual environment. In this context, a tourist is a specific type of person. 2. Asking a local: This part of the statement depicts an interaction between the tourist (a person) and a local, which can be a resident or someone well-acquainted with the place. The interaction involves a request for information or assistance. 3. For directions to their hotel: The subject of the interaction is specified here. The tourist is seeking guidance on how to reach their accommodation, which in this case, is a hotel. Combining these components creates the scenario where a tourist (a person) initiates a conversation with a local to obtain directions to their hotel. This clearly involves a person asking for directions. Therefore, the statement \\"A tourist asking a local for directions to their hotel\\" logically implies that \\"A person asks directions.\\" The latter statement is a simplified and generalized version of the former since it encompasses any instance when a person might ask for directions, not just when a tourist asks a local for directions to their hotel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who finds out his legion has been withholding letters from his brother's wife?  Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fights to finance the trip. Once in L.A.

Step 1: Analyze the question The question is asking where the man got the toothbrush, which was given to him for free. The available choices are: dentist office, bedroom, supermarket, drug store, and grocery store. Step 2: Consider the rationale The rationale for choosing \\"dentist office\\" as the answer is based on the fact that toothbrushes are commonly given away for free at dentist offices after checkups or cleanings. This is because dentists want to promote good oral hygiene and encourage their patients to brush their teeth regularly. Dentists may also provide a toothbrush that is specifically suited to a patient's dental needs, further emphasizing the relevance of the dentist office as a likely source for the toothbrush. Step 3: Eliminate other options - Bedroom: Toothbrushes are not typically given for free in bedrooms; they are generally purchased by the user and placed in their bedroom or bathroom.  - Supermarket, drug store, and grocery store: While these stores may sell toothbrushes, the question specifies that the toothbrush was given to the man for free, making these options less plausible.

Make a list of colleges: Look for colleges that offer engineering courses and are known for their quality education and good reputation. 2. Research their facilities: Check if they have good laboratories, equipment, libraries, and other important facilities for studying engineering. 3. Consider location: Think about whether you want to study near home or in another city or country. 4. Entrance requirements: Check the entrance exams and eligibility criteria required to get admission to these colleges. 5. Branch options: Look at the different branches of engineering each college offers, such as civil, mechanical, electrical, computer science, and so on. 6. Talk to people: Discuss with your teachers, seniors, or relatives who studied engineering to get advice on choosing a college and branch. Now, the second question: To choose the best branch in engineering for you, follow these steps: 1. Interests: Think about what subjects or topics you enjoy the most or are the most curious about. 2. Strengths: Identify your strong skills and abilities that could help you excel in a specific branch of engineering. 3.

Does \\"At the same time it must be noted that overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"From where did raiders come to attack the agrarian Indians?\\"","output":"The statement \\"At the same time, it must be noted that the overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam\\" does not directly answer the question \\"From where did raiders come to attack the agrarian Indians?\\" However, it does provide relevant information about the historical context of relations between Muslim and non-Muslim communities in India. To comprehensively answer the question, we need to delve deeper into the history of raids and invasions that affected the agrarian population of India. From the early medieval period, India witnessed a series of invasions and raids from various external forces. The following are some of the prominent sources of raiders that targeted agrarian Indians throughout history: 1. The Indo-Greek raids (circa 180 BCE - 10 CE): The invasion of India by the Indo-Greek Kingdom, a part of the Hellenistic world, led to some of the earliest recorded raids on agrarian Indian lands. These invasions were mainly concentrated in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. 2. The Scythians, Parthians, and Kushans (circa 2nd century BCE - 3rd century CE): Many central Asian tribes, including the Scythians (Sakas), Parthians (Pahlavas), and Kushans, made successive inroads into India. They raided agrarian regions and eventually established their respective dynasties on Indian soil. 3. The Hun invasions (circa 5th-6th century CE): The White Huns (also known as Hephthalites or Hunas) invaded the Indian subcontinent during the Gupta period. They attacked Indian agrarian settlements and inflicted significant damage on established administrative systems. 4. Arab incursions (circa 8th-10th century CE): Arab raiders and armies began attacking parts of India in the early medieval period following the Islamic Caliphate's expansion. Their raids targeted coastal areas, the Sindh region, and the northwestern frontiers of India. 5. Turkic and Afghan invasions (circa 11th-13th century CE): A series of invasions by Turkic and Afghan warlords, including Mahmud of Ghazni and Muhammad Ghori, severely affected large parts of northern and northwestern India. These invaders plundered the riches of urban centers and agrarian lands alike, leading to the emergence of the Delhi Sultanate. 6. Mongol invasions (circa 13th-14th century CE): Timur, the Turco-Mongol ruler, and other Mongol invaders launched a series of raids on northern and western India, targeting the Delhi Sultanate and agrarian hinterlands. While these invasions and raids were carried out by different empires and rulers, they all targeted the Indian subcontinent with varying degrees of success. The statement in question pertains more to the conversion of the native Indian population to Islam over centuries, which occurred through several factors, including trade, migration, and cultural assimilation. The process of conversion and the invasions that exposed the Indian subcontinent to experiences of religious pluralism and cultural diversity have contributed to shaping the complex socio-religious landscape that we see in India today. In conclusion, the statement does not directly answer the question about the origins of raiders, but by examining India's diverse history of invasions, we can better understand the context in which these events took place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

New owner later discovered that the cat had been lost by original owner. Cat and original owner were reunited and Gilmore found herself in court. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Siamese Kitten's Journey Home: Lost, Found, and Returned Article: It was a cold rainy day when Suzanne Gilmore stumbled upon a beautiful but shivering Siamese kitten lost on the streets of Blackpool. Her compassionate nature compelled her to take the abandoned feline to her own home, providing the kitten with a warm and cozy haven. Little did she know, this simple act of kindness would lead her on a unique and unexpected journey. For a month, Gilmore dedicated her time and resources to take care of the little cat. She fed it, groomed it, and made sure it remained in prime health. However, as the days went by, Gilmore began to realize the financial burden that comes with caring for a pet. The costs associated with vet bills, food, and litter started piling up, and the decision to keep the kitten became a challenging one. As much as she loved the feline companion, Gilmore came to the heart-wrenching decision to sell the kitten, hoping for it to find a forever-home where it could be cherished and cared for adequately. The new owner, whose identity remains undisclosed, welcomed the Siamese kitten with open arms and showered it with love and affection. However, this story took an unexpected turn when the new owner decided to take the kitten for a routine check-up at a local vet. At the vet's office, it was discovered that the feline had been microchipped, enabling the possibility of tracking down the kitten's original owner. Having fully understood the emotional weight of being separated from a beloved pet, the new owner pursued efforts to locate and reunite the kitten with its original family.  After further investigation, the original owner was found. It was revealed that they had been searching relentlessly for their missing pet, never losing optimism that they would be reunited one day. As fate would have it, they finally held their beloved Siamese kitten in their arms once again; the joy was palpable, and gratitude towards those who had taken care of their pet in tough times knew no bounds. The unforeseen and somewhat controversial consequence of this touching story emerged when Suzanne Gilmore found herself facing legal action. Upon learning that she had momentarily sold a lost cat, she was taken to court under the accusation of failing to report and return a lost pet. A debate arose over the ethics of selling a discovered pet and the responsibilities that should be enforced upon individuals in such situations. In conclusion, the heartening adventure of this Siamese kitten demonstrates the significance of modern technology, such as microchipping, in reuniting lost pets and their families. But it also raises essential questions regarding pet ownership and the responsibilities one has when finding a lost animal.  The Siamese kitten's journey reflects the unwavering bond between humans and their pets and serves as a testament that perseverance, hope, and empathy can bring about compelling stories and remarkable endings. And while Suzanne Gilmore's unintended consequences of her compassionate actions serve as a cautionary tale, it is a situation that we can all learn from, as we continue our lifelong partnerships with our beloved pets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Rocks commonly found in Beijing are often found spread out in smaller pieces, whereas rocks in Montreal typically remain large in size and don't break apart as much. Both Beijing and Montreal are expected to experience bouts of acid rain in the upcoming weeks.  Which area's rocks will have higher rates of chemical weathering caused by the acid rain?  Hint: Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases. With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur ( Figure below ). Let’s say you wanted to make some hot chocolate on a cold day. It would be hard to get a big chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have. Smaller pieces dissolve more easily. A:","output":"Based on the information given in your question and the provided hint, the rocks in Beijing will likely have higher rates of chemical weathering caused by the acid rain compared to those in Montreal.  This is because Beijing rocks are typically found in smaller pieces, and mechanical weathering, which breaks rock into smaller pieces, increases the rate of chemical weathering by providing more surface area on which chemical reactions can occur. Like in the hot chocolate example, the smaller particles or pieces (like a powder or chocolate chip) create more surfaces that can interact with the surrounding substance (like milk or hot water in the case of hot chocolate, or acid rain in the case of rocks), which makes dissolution or reaction easier and quicker. More surfaces exposed means more places for the acid rain to cause chemical weathering.  On the other hand, rocks in Montreal typically remain large in size and don't break apart as much, which means that they have less exposed surface area for chemical weathering to take place, and hence they exhibit lower rates of chemical weathering.   Therefore, in the forthcoming bouts of acid rain, we can expect the chemical weathering rates of rocks in Beijing to be higher than those in Montreal, provided all other conditions are similar."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Twitter timelines are filled with the horrors of war and unspeakable tragedy, so it was a blessed relief that late on Sunday night a tweet which was a source of unadulterated joy started to go viral.      Enter Keith Fraley, a 19-year-old second year student of software engineering at Michigan Tech college, and his tweet about his roommate, Mark, a mechanical engineering student, who arrived home wasted and managed to design an entire plane – and woke up with no memory the next day.

We spoke to Keith, with input from Mark.      What time did Mark come home, and what had he been drinking? Did he just bowl straight into the aircraft designing, or was there some lead up to this?      It all started around 11.30pm. Mark burst into the room in a drunken sway, asking where his textbooks were and after greeting me he rushed back out of the room. From what the person who brought him up [to the shared accommodation] was saying, Mark had a ton of rum and vodka-mixed drinks.      He then came stumbling back two minutes later to grab his giant whiteboard. I just laughed as I sat on the computer listening to his murmurs. Around 1.30am, he came back and he sat on the couch with a worn look on his face.      He came stumbling back two minutes later to grab his giant whiteboard      My friend Cody and I both looked at Mark as he then began to spew information about his whiteboard designed craft and the calculations behind it. Cody and I were in tears from laughter because the aerospace mathematics he tried telling us about sounded like a slurred robot. I did no encouraging towards the creation of this, but I did encourage him to continue talking because it was hilarious.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Keith Flaney and Mark, the designer of the plane. Photograph: Keith Flaney      Was anyone else lucky enough to witness this?      The guys that Mark shared drinks with were with him for more of the night than I was. They explained to me that Mark began a tantrum and began creating his design. Alex, a friend of Mark’s, said that he began staring at the ground and said that he asked for pen and paper immediately. After he sketched some designs, he said that he needed to leave and grab his aerospace mathematics textbook and whiteboard.      According to his drinking buddies, he was drawing frantically explaining his thoughts out loud and at the time he was very intoxicated. He was passing out on his whiteboard from time to time as well.      Mark’s designs are spread across graph paper, a whiteboard, and a notepad – that’s some real attention to detail and dedication …      Mark, although very intelligent towards math, also works towards industrial design and some minor graphic designing. It is no surprise to me that his work while intoxicated was still very visually appealing.      So, would the aircraft fly? Does the design hold up in a sober setting?      Well technically, it’s not an airplane like I claimed. It’s actually called an ekranoplan, which is more like a very high speed aircraft that floats above the water (Mark is trying to dumb this down for me). Mark says that he imagines his design may work, and he looks forward to trying to recreate his work into a remote-control model with his colleagues …      spookie jebbie⚛ (@debbiedontcare) @spasepeople this is the greatest thing I've seen on twitter all year      Has there ever been any kind of inebriated ekranoplan designing before? Or is it normally the more usual fare of traffic cones on heads and falling over garbage cans?      Well normally, we might slap “DRUNK” stickers on our foreheads, but Mark has brought new light to those of us who are unproductive drinkers. Most would think his actions were a result of Adderall or some crazy LSD but his actions were just down to being blackout drunk.      How does it feel for your tweet to have gone viral? It has now been retweeted almost 30,000 times and faved almost 50,000 times. Have your mentions been going crazy?      It was funny to think the tweet up, I could see one of my tweets finally getting some spotlight from my friends , but I couldn’t have imagined it getting as much attention as it did. We were counting the notifications as it went from zero activity to 27,000 retweets and 50,000 favourites in around 12 hours.      One person on Twitter said the tail prop would fail during steep climbs, due to low pressure behind the wing      What kind of feedback have you had for the tweet? Are people just in hysterics, or have there been engineers out there actually commenting on the design?      Almost all of the feedback we received was surprisingly positive, and many people joked saying that they wanted whatever Mark was having that night. A lot of people also commented saying “drunk goals”.      One person did call Mark out on his design, saying that the tail prop would fail during steep climbs due to low pressure behind the wing, and Mark replied saying that his design was actually an ekranoplan and not an airplane – so it lead to humorous and constructive responses.      ra6bit (@ra6bit) @spasepeople @hacks4pancakes That's both acceptable and makes the fact that he designed it while drunk funnier. Heh      Does he genuinely not remember designing the ekranoplan?      It’s actually really funny because he didn’t draw the design on the actual graph paper [in addition to the whiteboard] until he woke up the next morning. He woke me up and he must have been intoxicated still because as I watched him, he realised what he was doing and was struck with confusion and anger.      Next time, he plans on curing cancer      He doesn’t remember a thing – even the next morning at 9am. He then fell asleep in his chair and woke up about an hour later basically questioning his sanity because of the immense amount of work that was in front of him, with no memory of his motivation to do it.      What does Mark plan on designing next time he is drunk?      He plans on trying to cure cancer or to finalise his design plans for the craft in Siemens NX to be 3D printed later for prototyping.      Finally, if you could both get drunk and design an aircraft with anyone in the world (dead or alive), who would it be?      If we could both get drunk and design an aircraft, Mark explained that he would want it to be with the man who invented and designed the world’s first ekranoplan, Rostislav Alexeyev. I would probably just sit back and document the entire thing on Twitter.      • You can follow Keith on Twitter: @spasepeople ||||| \\"Ekranoplan\\" redirects here. For the album by Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound, see Ekranoplan (album)      A ground-effect vehicle (GEV) is a vehicle that is designed to attain sustained flight over a level surface (usually over the sea) by making use of ground effect, the aerodynamic interaction between the wings and the surface. Among the best known are the Soviet ekranoplans, but names like wing-in-ground-effect (WIG), flarecraft, sea skimmer, or wing-in-surface-effect ship (WISE) are also used.      In recent years a large number of different GEV types have been developed for both civilian and military use. However, these craft have yet to enter widespread use.      Although they may look and have related technical characteristics similar to seaplanes, ground-effect vehicles are generally not designed to fly out of ground effect. They are also dissimilar from hovercraft or hydrofoils, as they do not have any contact with the surface of the water when in \\"flight\\". Ground-effect vehicles constitute a completely unique class of transportation.      Design [ edit ]      A ground-effect vehicle needs some forward velocity to produce lift dynamically and the principal benefit of operating a wing in ground effect is to reduce its lift-dependent drag. The basic design principle is that the closer the wing operates to an external surface such as the ground, said to be in ground effect, the more efficient it becomes.      An airfoil passing through air increases air pressure on the underside, while decreasing pressure across the top. The high and low pressures are maintained until they flow off the ends of the wings, where they form vortices which in turn are the major cause of lift-induced drag—normally a large portion of the drag affecting an aircraft. The higher the aspect ratio of the wing (that is, the longer and skinnier it is), the less induced drag created for each unit of lift and the greater the efficiency of the particular wing. This is the primary reason gliders have long and skinny wings.      Placing the same wing near a surface such as the water or the ground has the effect of greatly increasing the aspect ratio, but without having the complications associated with a long and slender wing, so that the short stubs on an Ekranoplan can produce just as much lift as the much larger wing on a transport aircraft, though it can only do this when close to the earth's surface. Once sufficient speed has built up, some GEVs may be capable of leaving ground effect and functioning as normal aircraft until they approach their destination. The distinguishing characteristic is that they are unable to land or take off without a significant amount of help from the ground effect cushion, and cannot climb until they have reached a much higher speed.      A GEV is sometimes characterized as a transition between a hovercraft and an aircraft, although this is not correct as a hovercraft is statically supported upon a cushion of pressurised air from an onboard downward-directed fan. Some GEV designs, such as the Russian Lun and Dingo, have used forced blowing under the wing by auxiliary engines to increase the high pressure area under the wing to assist the takeoff; however they differ from hovercraft in still requiring forward motion to generate sufficient lift to fly.      Wing configurations [ edit ]      Ekranoplan; (B) Reverse-delta wing; (C) Tandem wing. WIG-wings configurations: (A)Ekranoplan; (B)Reverse-delta wing; (C)Tandem wing.      A Russian light ekranoplan Aquaglide-2      Ekranoplan wing [ edit ]      This was the profile designed by Rostislav Alexeyev. The wings are significantly shorter than those of comparable aircraft, and this configuration requires a high aft-placed horizontal tail to maintain stability. The pitch and altitude stability comes from the lift slope[note 1] difference between a front low wing in ground effect (commonly the main wing) and an aft, higher-located second wing nearly out of ground effect (generally named a stabilizer).      Reverse delta wing [ edit ]      Developed by Alexander Lippisch, this wing allows stable flight in ground effect through self stabilization. This is the main Class B form of ground effect craft.      Tandem wings [ edit ]      Tandem wing can have two configurations:      A biplane-style type-1 utilising a shoulder-mounted main lift wing and belly-mounted sponsons similar to those on combat and transport helicopters.

A tandem wing style with double-wing system as tandem-airfoil flairboat constructions by the aerodynamic specialist Dipl. Ing. Günther W. Jörg. This system is self-stabilizing and provides secure, comfortable and high-efficiency operation.      Classification [ edit ]      One difficulty which has delayed GEV development is the classification and legislation to be applied. The International Maritime Organisation has studied the application of rules based on the International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft (HSC code) which was developed for fast ships such as hydrofoils, hovercraft, catamarans and the like. The Russian Rules for classification and construction of small type A ekranoplans is a document upon which most GEV design is based. However, in 2005, the IMO classified the WISE or GEV craft under the category of ships.[1]      The International Maritime Organisation recognizes three types of ground effect craft:[2]      A craft which is certified for operation only in ground effect; A craft which is certified to temporarily increase its altitude to a limited height outside the influence of ground effect but not exceeding 150 m above the surface; and A craft which is certified for operation outside ground effect and exceeding 150 m above the surface.      These classes currently only apply to craft carrying 12 passengers or more.      Advantages and disadvantages [ edit ]      Given similar hull size and power, and depending on its specific design, the lower lift-induced drag of a ground-effect craft, as compared to an aircraft of similar capacity, will improve its fuel efficiency and, up to a point, its speed. Ground-effect craft also are much faster than surface vessels of similar power, because they avoid drag from the water.      On the water the aircraft-like construction of ground-effect craft increases the risk of damage, should they fail to avoid other vessels. Furthermore, the limited number of egress points make it more difficult to evacuate the vehicle in an emergency.      Since most ground-effect craft are designed to operate from water, accidents and engine failure typically are less hazardous than in a land-based aircraft, but the lack of altitude control leaves the pilot with fewer options for avoiding collision, and to some extent that discounts such benefits. Low altitude brings high speed craft into conflict with ships, buildings and rising land, which may not be sufficiently visible in poor conditions to avoid, and the ground-effect vehicle may be unable to climb over or turn sharply enough to avoid collisions while drastic, low level maneuvers risk contact with solid or water hazards beneath. Aircraft can climb over most obstacles, but ground-effect vehicles are more limited.      In high winds, take-off must be into the wind, which takes the craft across successive lines of waves, causing heavy pounding, which both stresses the craft and makes passengers uncomfortable. In light winds, waves may be in any direction, which can make control difficult as each wave causes the vehicle to both pitch and roll. Their light construction makes their ability to operate in higher sea states less than that of conventional ships, but greater than the ability of hovercraft or hydrofoils, which are closer to the surface of the water. The demise of the seaplane was a result of its inability to take off or land in rough sea conditions even while flying conditions were good, and its use only lasted until runways were more commonly available. Ground-effect vehicles are similarly limited.      Like conventional aircraft, greater power is needed for takeoff, and, like seaplanes, ground-effect vehicles must get on the step before they can accelerate to flight speed. Careful design, usually with multiple redesigns of hullforms, is required to get this right, which increases engineering costs. This obstacle is more difficult for ground-effect vehicles with short production runs to overcome. For the vehicle to work, its hull needs to be stable enough longitudinally to be controllable yet not so stable that it cannot lift off the water.      The bottom of the vehicle must be formed to avoid excessive pressures on landing and taking off without sacrificing too much lateral stability, and it must not create too much spray, which damages the airframe and the engines. The Russian Ekranoplans show evidence of fixes for these exact problems in the form of multiple chines on the forward part of the hull undersides and in the forward location of the jet engines.      Finally, limited utility has kept production levels low enough that it has been impossible to amortize development costs sufficiently to make ground-effect vehicles competitive with conventional aircraft.      History [ edit ]      By the 1920s, the ground effect phenomenon was well-known, as pilots found that their airplanes appeared to become more efficient as they neared the runway surface during landing. In 1934 the US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics issued Technical Memorandum 771, Ground Effect on the Takeoff and Landing of Airplanes, which was a translation into English of a summary of research up to that point on the subject. The French author Maurice Le Sueur had added a suggestion based on this phenomenon: \\"Here the imagination of inventors is offered a vast field. The ground interference reduces the power required for level flight in large proportions, so here is a means of rapid and at the same time economic locomotion: Design an airplane which is always within the ground-interference zone. At first glance this apparatus is dangerous because the ground is uneven and the altitude called skimming permits no freedom of maneuver. But on large-sized aircraft, over water, the question may be attempted ...\\"[3]      By the 1960s, the technology started maturing, in large part due to the independent contributions of Rostislav Alexeyev in the Soviet Union[4] and German Alexander Lippisch, working in the United States. Alexeyev worked from his background as a ship designer whereas Lippisch worked as an aeronautical engineer. The influence of Alexeyev and Lippisch remains noticeable in most GEV vehicles seen today.      Soviet Union [ edit ]      Led by Alexeyev, the Soviet Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau (Russian: ЦКБ СПК) was the center of ground-effect craft development in the USSR. The vehicle came to be known as an ekranoplan (Russian: экранопла́н, экран screen + план plan, from Russian: эффект экрана, literally screen effect, or ground effect in English). The military potential for such a craft was soon recognized and Alexeyev received support and financial resources from Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.      Some manned and unmanned prototypes were built, ranging up to eight tons in displacement. This led to the development of a 550-ton military ekranoplan of 92 m (302 ft) length. The craft was dubbed the Caspian Sea Monster by U.S. intelligence experts, after a huge, unknown craft was spotted on satellite reconnaissance photos of the Caspian Sea area in the 1960s. With its short wings, it looked airplane-like in planform, but would obviously be incapable of flight.[5] Although it was designed to travel a maximum of 3 m (9.8 ft) above the sea, it was found to be most efficient at 20 m (66 ft), reaching a top speed of 300–400 kn (560–740 km/h; 350–460 mph) in research flights.      The Soviet ekranoplan program continued with the support of Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov. It produced the most successful ekranoplan so far, the 125-ton A-90 Orlyonok. These craft were originally developed as high-speed military transports and were usually based on the shores of the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. The Soviet Navy ordered 120 Orlyonok-class ekranoplans, but this figure was later reduced to fewer than 30 vessels, with planned deployment mainly in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea fleets.      A few Orlyonoks served with the Soviet Navy from 1979 to 1992. In 1987, the 400-ton Lun-class ekranoplan was built as a missile launcher. A second Lun, renamed Spasatel, was laid down as a rescue vessel, but was never finished. The two major problems that the Soviet ekranoplans faced were poor longitudinal stability and a need for reliable navigation.      Minister Ustinov died in 1985, and the new Minister of Defence, Marshal Sokolov, cancelled funding for the program. Only three operational Orlyonok-class ekranoplans (with revised hull design) and one Lun-class ekranoplan remained at a naval base near Kaspiysk.      Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, ekranoplans have been produced by the Volga Shipyard[6] in Nizhniy Novgorod. Smaller ekranoplans for non-military use have been under development. The CHDB had already developed the eight-seat Volga-2 in 1985, and Technologies and Transport is developing a smaller version called the Amphistar. Beriev proposed a large craft of the type, the Be-2500, as a \\"flying ship\\" cargo carrier,[7] but nothing came of the project.      Germany [ edit ]      Lippisch Type and Hanno Fischer [ edit ]      The Rhein-Flugzeugbau X-114 in flight.      In Germany, Lippisch was asked to build a very fast boat for American businessman Arthur A. Collins. In 1963 Lippisch developed the X-112, a revolutionary design with reversed delta wing and T-tail. This design proved to be stable and efficient in ground effect and even though it was successfully tested, Collins decided to stop the project and sold the patents to a German company called Rhein Flugzeugbau (RFB), which further developed the inverse delta concept into the X-113 and the six seat X-114. These craft could be flown out of ground effect so that, for example, peninsulas could be overflown.[8]      Hanno Fischer took over the works from RFB and created his own company, Fischer Flugmechanik, which eventually completed two models. The Airfisch 3 carried two persons, and the FS-8 carried six persons. The FS-8 was to be developed by Fischer Flugmechanik for a Singapore-Australian joint venture called Flightship. Powered by a V8 Chevrolet automobile engine rated at 337 kW, the prototype made its first flight in February 2001 in the Netherlands.[9] The company no longer exists but the prototype craft was bought by Wigetworks, a company based in Singapore and renamed as AirFish 8. In 2010, that vehicle was registered as a ship in the Singapore Registry of Ships.[10]      The University of Duisburg-Essen is supporting an ongoing research project to develop the Hoverwing.[11]      Gunther-Jörg-type tandem-airfoil flairboat [ edit ]      A tandem flarecraft Skimmerfoil Jörg IV located at the SAAF Museum , Port Elizabeth, South Africa      German engineer Günther Jörg, who had worked on Alexeyev's first designs and was familiar with the challenges of GEV design, developed a GEV with two wings in a tandem arrangement, the Jörg-II. It was the third, manned, tandem-airfoil boat, named \\"Skimmerfoil\\", which was developed during his consultancy period in South Africa. It was a simple and low-cost design of a first 4-seater tandem-airfoil flairboat completely constructed of aluminium. The prototype has been in the SAAF Port Elizabeth Museum since 4 July 2007, remained there till (2013) and is now in private use. Pictures of the museum show the boat after a period of some years outside the museum and without protection against the sun.[12]      The consultancy of Dipl. Ing. Günther Jörg who was specialist and insider of German Airplane Industrie up from 1963 and a colleague of Alexander Lippisch and Hanno Fischer as well, was founded with a fundamental knowledge of Wing in ground effect physics, as well as results of fundamental tests under different conditions and designs having begun in 1960. During a period of more than 30 years Dipl. Ing. Gunther W. Jörg managed to built and fly successful a series of 15 different tandem-airfoil flairboats in different sizes and made of different materials.      The following tandem-airfoil flairboat (TAF) types had been built after a previous period of nearly 10 years of research and development:      TAB VII-3: First manned tandem W.I.G type Jörg, buing built at Technical University of Darmstadt, Akaflieg; TAF VII-5: Second manned tandem-airfoil Flairboat, 2 seater made of wood. TAF VIII-1: 2-seater tandem-airfoil flairboat built of GRP / Aluminium. A small serie of 6 Flairboats had been produced by former Botec Company. TAF VIII-2: 4-seater tandem-airfoil Flairboat built of full aluminium (2 units) and built of GRP (3 Units) TAF VIII-3: 8-seater tandemIrfoil Flairboat built of aluminium combined with GRP parts. TAF VIII-4: 12-seater tandem Airfoil Flairboat built of aluminium combined with GRP parts as well. TAF VIII-3B: 6-seater tandem-airfoil flairboat under carbon fibre composite construction.      Bigger concepts are: 25-seater, 32-seater, 60-seater, 80-seater and bigger up to the size of a passenger airplane.      All those tandem-airfoil flairboats are registered as motorboat and classified as type A WIG. In 1984, Gunther W. Jörg was decorated with \\"Philip Morris Award\\" for future transportation. In 1987, the Botec Company was founded. After his death in 2010 business is continued by his daughter and former assistant Ingrid Schellhaas with her company Tandem WIG Consulting.      Since the 1980s [ edit ]      GEVs developed since the 1980s have been primarily smaller craft designed for the recreational and civilian ferry markets. Germany, Russia and the United States have provided most of the momentum with some development in Australia, China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. In these countries and regions, small craft up to ten seats have been designed and built. Other larger designs as ferries and heavy transports have been proposed, but have not been carried to fruition.      Besides the development of appropriate design and structural configuration, special automatic control systems and navigation systems are also being developed. These include special altimeters with high accuracy for small altitude measurements and also lesser dependence on weather conditions. After extensive research and experimentation, it has been shown that \\"phase radio altimeters\\" are most suitable for such applications as compared to laser altimeter, isotropic or ultrasonic altimeters.[13]      With Russian consultation, the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) studied Aerocon's 170-metre long (550-foot) wingship.[14][15][16][17][18][19]      A Hoverwing      Universal Hovercraft developed a flying hovercraft, a prototype of which first took flight in 1996.[20] Since 1999, the company has offered plans, parts, kits and manufactured GEV hovercraft called the Hoverwing.[21]      In Singapore, Wigetworks has continued development and obtained certification from Lloyd's Register for entry into class.[22] On 31 March 2011 AirFish 8-001 became one of the first WIG to be flagged with the Singapore Registry of Ships, one of the largest ship registries.[23] Wigetworks has also partnered with National University of Singapore's Engineering Department to develop higher capacity WIG craft.[24]      In Korea, Wing Ship Technology Corporation has developed and tested a 50-seat passenger version of a WIG craft named the WSH-500.[25]      Iran deployed three squadrons of Bavar 2 two-seat GEVs in September, 2010. This GEV carries one machine gun and surveillance gear, and incorporates features which reduce its radar signature in a similar manner to stealth.[26] In October 2014, satellite images showed new images of the Ekranoplan in a shipyard in south of Iran. The Ekranoplan has two engines and no armament.[27]      The designers Burt Rutan in 2011[28] and Korolev in 2015 have shown ekranoplan projects.[29]      Estonian transport company Sea Wolf Express plans to launch passenger service in 2019 between Helsinki and Tallinn, a distance of 87 km taking only half an hour, using a Russian-built ground effect vehicle (GEV).[30] The company has ordered 15 GEVs with maximum speed of 185 km/h and capacity of 12 passengers and they are built by Russian RDC Aqualines.[31]      See also [ edit ]      Notes [ edit ]      ^ Cl/da, with Cl = lift coefficient, and a = angle of incidence. ^ Not a stabilizer because destabilizing.

When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to...

See options at the end Patricia's habit of tanning frequently in a tanning bed contrasts with Erin's habit of spray tanning, so  Options: A). Patricia is at a lower risk of skin cancer. B). Erin is at a lower risk of skin cancer.","output":"B). Erin is at a lower risk of skin cancer. The complete sentence would be: Patricia's habit of tanning frequently in a tanning bed contrasts with Erin's habit of spray tanning, so Erin is at a lower risk of skin cancer. To further understand the reasoning behind this answer, let's delve deeper into the risks associated with tanning beds and spray tanning. Tanning Beds: Tanning beds work by emitting ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which stimulates melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin, to produce melanin. This gives the skin a tanned appearance. However, exposure to UV radiation comes with several risks, among which skin cancer is a major concern. According to the American Academy of Dermatology and the World Health Organization, using tanning beds can significantly increase the risk of developing melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Furthermore, tanning beds can cause premature skin aging, weaken the immune system, and damage the skin's DNA, which could lead to a higher probability of mutations and ultimately skin cancer. Studies have shown that using tanning beds before the age of 35 increases the risk of melanoma by 59%. Those who are exposed to high levels of UV radiation, either from tanning beds or sunlight, are more likely to develop basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, other types of skin cancer. Spray Tanning: On the other hand, Erin's habit of spray tanning represents a safer alternative to tanning beds. Spray tanning solutions typically contain an FDA-approved active ingredient called dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which reacts with the amino acids in the dead surface cells of the skin to temporarily tint the skin's outermost layer. As spray tanning does not use UV radiation, it does not increase the risk of skin cancer, making it a safer choice for those seeking a tanned appearance. Moreover, spray tanning does not produce the same harmful side effects as tanning bed exposure, such as premature skin aging, immune system suppression, and potential DNA damage. Although spray tanning might not be entirely risk-free, as some individuals may experience sensitivities or allergic reactions to its ingredients, it is generally considered a safer option when compared to tanning beds. In conclusion, Erin's habit of spray tanning places her at a significantly lower risk of skin cancer than Patricia's frequent tanning bed use. It is important to remember that the safest way to achieve a tanned look without exposing oneself to the harmful effects of UV radiation is to opt for sunless tanners like spray tanning or self-tanning lotions. Additionally, everyone should practice sun safety measures such as wearing protective clothing, seeking shade, and using broad-spectrum sunscreen to prevent skin cancer and other skin damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV. Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Worried that Jack may be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. Though Jack and Bernie get off to a good start, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. Things are made worse when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrnes' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack's back during a game of football. Meanwhile Pam informs Greg that she's pregnant, and the two decide to keep it secret from Jack. Jack again becomes suspicious of Greg's integrity and quality, when they are introduced to the Fockers' housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos (Alanna Ubach), with whom Bernie reveals Greg had a sexual affair fifteen years before.

Do these mean the same? The RFPs also tend to be dominated by turbulent phenomena and other non-ideal effects . RFPs also tend to be controlled by non-ideal phenomena and turbulent effects .","output":"While both sentences provided convey a similar message, they do not mean exactly the same thing. Let's examine the subtle differences between the two and analyze their meanings. 1. The RFPs also tend to be dominated by turbulent phenomena and other non-ideal effects. This statement suggests that the RFPs (Request for Proposals) are heavily influenced or dominated by turbulent phenomena (disorder, instability, or unsteady flow characteristics). The \\"other non-ideal effects\\" implies that there might be additional variables or factors that hinder the desired outcome or optimal characteristics in the system being studied. The word \\"dominated\\" signifies that these factors have a significant impact on the RFPs, potentially making it difficult to achieve optimal performance or design solutions. 2. RFPs also tend to be controlled by non-ideal phenomena and turbulent effects. In this statement, the RFPs are said to be \\"controlled\\" by non-ideal phenomena and turbulent effects. Here, the term \\"controlled\\" means that the RFPs are largely influenced and determined by these factors. Non-ideal phenomena refer to various unwanted effects or influences that prevent a system from operating perfectly, and turbulent effects refer to the disorder, instability, or unsteady flow characteristics that can affect the performance of the system. Despite being similar in meaning to the first sentence, this statement places less emphasis on \\"other\\" non-ideal effects, instead primarily focusing on the non-ideal phenomena and turbulent effects themselves. In summary, both sentences revolve around the idea that the RFPs are substantially impacted by turbulent phenomena and non-ideal effects. The first statement emphasizes that there may be additional, unspecified non-ideal effects that influence the RFPs, while the second statement focuses more on the turbulent and non-ideal phenomena themselves. The primary difference between the two sentences is the level of emphasis on \\"other non-ideal effects\\" versus the turbulent effects and non-ideal phenomena that directly control the RFPs. However, it is important to note that their general message is still quite similar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Have you ever sat around and thought about how you’d create your dream kitchen if you had the chance? Well, we are on the verge of a move (whenever the house sells, we’ll move), and I keep thinking that I need to sit down and write a list of our “would likes” and our “must haves.” That way, when we are house hunting, we’ll already know what we’re looking for. For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I’d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it’d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road! When you’re preparing a lot of food, you’re typically buying a lot of products, and the garbage and recycling bins fill up faster than ever as well. The second dream kitchen appliance I wouldn’t mind having would be the KitchenAid Trash Compactor, reducing our use of garbage bags and trips to the outside dumpster. Plus, I think I’d like not having to smell the garbage all the time! Where is the dream kitchen?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In Masai culture, it is traditional to open a conversation with \\"Casserian engeri,\\" which means \\"And how are the children?\\" The prominent value that the Masai place on the well-being of their children has me thinking about the well-being of our own children here in America. We rejoice with those who crossed the stage to receive their high school diplomas last spring, and look forward to the accomplishments of those who start school soon. Indeed, our children are doing well. For the first time in our nation's history, 80% of young Americans graduated from high school on time, according to the 2014 Building a GradNation. This is a significant achievement for those young graduates and our country as a whole. At that rate of increase, we can and should push forward to the goal of 90% on-time high school graduation by 2020. Four successive presidents have set forth this goal, and at last we are on track. But this statistic tells only a piece of the story about the well-being of our children. It disregards too quickly the remaining 20% -- about 800,000 young people per year -- who don't graduate on time. What happens to them? Why are these young people not progressing, despite all of our best efforts? Who are they? And what must we do to help them stay on track and thrive as contributors to the economy of our country? Over the past year, America's Promise Alliance has been seeking those answers, right from the source. Our Center for Promise at Tufts University interviewed hundreds of young people who did not graduate on time or at all. And then we surveyed thousands of young people from all 50 states. So, how are our children? Their responses, compiled and analyzed in the report \\"Don't Call Them Dropouts,\\" are heartbreaking, humbling and ultimately hopeful. So many young people described the circumstances in which they grew up, environments made toxic by physical and emotional abuse, exposure to extreme violence, family stress and caretaking responsibilities. Young people have many reasons for leaving school, not all of them related to boredom or lack of motivation. Many leave because of complex and challenging life circumstances that, without proper adult support, make leaving school look like the only option. In the wake of leaving school without graduating, many showed tremendous optimism and a drive to achieve adult success. They want for themselves what we want for them: more education, a solid job, a strong family, a stable place to live. With this backdrop, it's no surprise that many of the people we interviewed took exception to the term \\"dropout.\\" They don't feel that they \\"dropped out\\" or, worse, quit. They simply made a decision to change the course of their lives. Nothing will be easy about increasing our national high school graduation rates. However, for the sake of our nation's future, we must not forget about the potential that exists in 20% of our nation's students. Yes, all students need high quality schools with strong teachers and strong curricula, but they also need environments where they are heard. Set preconceptions and assumptions aside, and just listen hard. Try to understand their experiences and perspective, however challenging. Show them, in some way, that you care about their future. For our young adults with the highest needs, more schools should incorporate an early warning system to identify students whose attendance, behavior and course performance suggest that they need extra support to stay in school. Communities should consider how to create similar early-warning supports and systems beyond the school building for young adults affected by risk factors like a death in the family, an incarcerated parent or housing instability. As good stewards of our communities, we must help provide the support that our young people need for success, and that means learning from one another. With proven and promising examples of success happening all across the country, in and out of the classroom, we must create more opportunities for school systems and communities to collaborate with one another. It's in that sharing, that great progress can be made. The question \\"How are our children?\\" is the right one to be asking. But, let's not be afraid of the challenging and complex answers that comes with it. At graduation season, and every day, let's celebrate our high achievers while giving equal care to those young people taking the less common road. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article highlights the importance of focusing on the well-being of children and emphasizes the successes and challenges faced by young Americans in the education system. It discusses the significant achievement of an 80% on-time high school graduation rate in the US and the goal to reach 90% by 2020. However, the article also addresses the remaining 20% (approximately 800,000) of youth who do not graduate on time or at all and the need to understand their reasons, provide necessary support, and envision their potential.

Their stories reveal complex and challenging life circumstances that often led to their decision to leave school, with many expressing optimism and ambition for adult success. To improve the well-being and graduation rates of all children, the article suggests implementing early warning systems in schools to identify at-risk students, collaborating with school systems and communities to share best practices, and fostering environments where young people feel heard and supported.

During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- A Duluth, Minnesota, police officer will face criminal charges for, as a video shows, beating up a man in a detox facility last month, the city's police department said Thursday. Shawn Reed, the independent counsel looking into the case, decided Thursday to press charges against Officer Richard Jouppi, according to a news release from Duluth police. Jouppi will face counts of fifth-degree assault and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. The officer's attorney, Frederic Bruno, defended his clients' actions as \\"100%\\" justified. According to a police report written by Jouppi, officers responded on September 21 to transport a man -- later identified as Anthony Jackson -- who witnesses described as being \\"extremely intoxicated (and) in two fights tonight.\\" Duluth police spokesman Jim Hansen said last Friday that officers had gone to a halfway house because Jackson had violated its no-drinking policy. \\"I controlled his right arm at the elbow in order to prevent Jackson from falling through with his threat to strike (a) staff member,\\"","output":"Jouppi wrote in the report. The officer added that Jackson was repeatedly uncooperative and verbally abusive as they tried to escort him to the patrol car. The police report also mentioned that Jackson continued to be aggressive and non-compliant during the transport to the detox facility. Once at the detox center, surveillance video showed Officer Jouppi restraining Jackson in a chair as an attempt to control his aggressive behavior. In the video, it appeared that Jackson attempted to push the officer away, causing Jouppi to respond by repeatedly striking Jackson in the face and upper body. Other officers and staff members at the facility quickly rushed in to intervene and separate the two. Jackson was left with visible bruises and cuts on his face, which later required medical attention. The surveillance video, which was later released to the public, sparked outrage in the community and led to the investigation by independent counsel Shawn Reed. During the investigation, Reed reviewed the video, interviewed witnesses, and gathered all available evidence from the incident. In a press conference on Thursday, Reed announced the decision to charge Officer Jouppi with fifth-degree assault and disorderly conduct. He stated that the video, along with witness statements, portrayed an excessive use of force against Jackson. \\"Although officers are granted some leniency in using physical force when necessary, Officer Jouppi's actions in this situation clearly crossed the line,\\" Reed said. \\"The evidence shows that the force used was disproportionate to the threat Mr. Jackson posed at the time.\\" In response to the charges, Officer Jouppi's attorney, Frederic Bruno, insisted that his client's actions were justified, given Jackson's aggressive behavior and intoxication level. Bruno argued that Jouppi had used reasonable force to protect himself and others in the facility from potential harm. The Duluth Police Department has placed Officer Jouppi on administrative leave pending the outcome of the criminal case and an internal review of his conduct. The department's spokesperson, Jim Hansen, stated that the incident does not reflect the values of the police force, and they will work to ensure that trust is rebuilt with the community. \\"We at the Duluth Police Department hold our officers to high standards of professionalism, and we strive to serve our community with respect,\\" Hansen said. \\"We will continue to provide our officers with appropriate training in the use of force and de-escalation techniques to prevent situations like this from occurring in the future.\\" Anthony Jackson's family announced they have filed a civil lawsuit against the officer and the Duluth Police Department, seeking damages and the implementation of new police policies and procedures.

Article:Peter Rattray, Michael O'Byrne and Blaze O'Byrne travelled from the site of the 1879 conflict, made famous by the endeavours of Welsh soldiers. They brought two artefacts from the battle with them for The Royal Welsh Regimental Museum at Brecon. Mr Rattray's family has a close relationship with the Royal Welsh. They run the Fugitives' Drift hotel, near the battlefield, and have hosted dozens of members of the Brecon-based regiment, whose descendants fought in Rorke's Drift. They also conduct battlefield tours, recounting tales of the Welsh soldiers' heroics during the Anglo-Zulu war. Mr Rattray and his two friends have crossed Africa, the Middle East and Europe on their way to the museum on Saturday morning. They have brought with them a traditional Zulu assegai spear and a British boot plate, which was found on the battlefield, for the museum. Mr Rattray said finally seeing Brecon would be a special moment, especially as his father made numerous trips to talk about the battle. \\"To finally have an opportunity to see the significant sites in Wales and visit the home of the Royal Welsh is something I have looked forward to for most of my life,\\" he said. \\"To me, this is such an incredible opportunity to view these places my father told me so much about. \\"Most importantly for me though, I want to visit the garden of The Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon.

This, for me, is the main reason I want to visit Brecon.\\" The Battle of Rorke's Drift took place on 22 and 23 January 1879. Following their defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana the previous day, 150 British and colonial troops were cornered in a small makeshift garrison by thousands of Zulu warriors. Despite injuries to virtually every man, and almost running out of ammunition, this tiny force held out for more than 10 hours until the Zulu onslaught finally subsided. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders - more than in any single engagement in British military history. The events were famously depicted in the 1964 film Zulu, starring Stanley Baker and Michael Caine.

Sentence 2: For a moment the sickening anxiety had disappeared, but soon came back. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Options are:  1). yes.  2). it is not possible to tell.  3). no.","output":"Option 1, yes, is the correct answer. The second sentence can be considered true if the first sentence is true. Let's analyze both sentences: Sentence 1: \\"The sickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing Jane Finn was found at last, swept over him again.\\" This sentence tells us the following: - The subject experienced sickening anxiety. - The anxiety was temporarily forgotten due to the excitement of finding Jane Finn. - The anxiety returned (\\"swept over him again\\") after that temporary reprieve. Sentence 2: \\"For a moment the sickening anxiety had disappeared, but soon came back.\\" This sentence also tells us the following: - The subject experienced sickening anxiety. - The anxiety disappeared for a moment, which can also be understood as it being forgotten for a while. - The anxiety came back after it had disappeared. By comparing the key points of these two sentences, we can see that they both follow the same pattern of anxiety disappearing temporarily and then coming back. Both sentences describe that the subject forgot or no longer experienced the sickening anxiety for a short period of time, only for it to return. So, when we evaluate the second sentence based on the knowledge gained from the first sentence, we can conclude that the second sentence is true.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) engages the United States science community, sponsors scientific research, and develops and deploys satellites and probes in collaboration with NASAs partners around the world to answer fundamental questions requiring the view from and into space.  - Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is a robotic space probe mission to Mars launched by NASA on November 26, 2011, which successfully landed \\"Curiosity\\", a Mars rover, in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012. The overall objectives include investigating Mars' habitability, studying its climate and geology, and collecting data for a manned mission to Mars. The rover carries a variety of scientific instruments designed by an international team.  - Arizona State University (commonly referred to as ASU or Arizona State) is a public metropolitan research university on five campuses across the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area, and four regional learning centers throughout Arizona. The 2016 university ratings by \\"U.S. News & World Report\\" rank ASU No. 1 among the Most Innovative Schools in America for the second year in a row.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.  - Louis Dill Friedman (born July 7, 1941) is an American astronautics engineer and space spokesperson. He was born in New York and raised in the Bronx. Dr. Friedman was a co-founder of The Planetary Society with Carl Sagan and Bruce C. Murray.  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - Lockheed Martin is an American global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies company with worldwide interests. It was formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation with Martin Marietta in March 1995. It is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, in the Washington, DC, area. Lockheed Martin employs 126,000 people worldwide. Marillyn Hewson is the current President and Chief Executive Officer.  - James ( Jim ) F.

His book Postcards from Mars includes many images taken by the Mars rovers . Dr. Bell is currently an editor of the space science journal Icarus and president of The Planetary Society . He has served as the lead scientist in charge of the Panoramic camera ( Pancam ) color imaging system on Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity .  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - Mars Pathfinder (MESUR Pathfinder) is an American robotic spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars in 1997. It consisted of a lander, renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station, and a lightweight (10.6 kg/23 lb) wheeled robotic Mars rover named \\"Sojourner\\", which became the first rover to operate outside  the Earth-Moon system.  - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - A robot is a machineespecially one programmable by a computercapable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look.  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA ) is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - Aeronautics (from the ancient Greek words  \\"r\\", which means \\"air\\", and  \\"nautik\\" which means \\"navigation\\", i.e. \\"navigation into the air\\") is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of \\"aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering\\" and \\"the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics).\\"   - Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth (aeronautics) and surrounding space (astronautics). Aerospace organisations research, design, manufacture, operate, or maintain aircraft and/or spacecraft. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial and military applications.  - The Planetary Society is an American internationally active non-governmental, nonprofit foundation. It is involved in research, public outreach, and political advocacy for engineering projects related to astronomy, planetary science, and space exploration. It was founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, and has over 40,000 members from more than one hundred countries around the world.  - Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934  December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, science popularizer, and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences. He is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE, FRAS (16 December 1917  19 March 2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer and futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit. The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The mission is managed by the California Institute of Technology, at the JPL, in La Cañada Flintridge, California, for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. It was launched August 12, 2005, and attained Martian orbit on March 10, 2006. In November 2006, after five months of aerobraking, it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase. As MRO entered orbit, it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet's surface: \\"Mars Global Surveyor\\", \\"Mars Express\\", \\"2001 Mars Odyssey\\", and the two Mars Exploration Rovers (\\"Spirit\\" and \\"Opportunity\\"); at the time, this set a record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars. \\"Mars Global Surveyor\\" and the \\"Spirit\\" rover have since ceased to function; the remainder remain operational as of September 2016.  - A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them.  - Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.  - In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. \\"Wave motion\\" transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumthat is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations.  - 2001 Mars Odyssey is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet Mars. The project was developed by NASA, and contracted out to Lockheed Martin, with an expected cost for the entire mission of US297 million. Its mission is to use spectrometers and a thermal imager to detect evidence of past or present water and ice, as well as study the planet's geology and radiation environment. It is hoped that the data Odyssey obtains will help answer the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars and create a risk-assessment of the radiation future astronauts on Mars might experience. It also acts as a relay for communications between the Mars Exploration Rovers, Mars Science Laboratory, and previously the Phoenix lander to Earth. The mission was named as a tribute to Arthur C. Clarke, evoking the name of \\"\\".    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'james f. bell' with the relationship of 'occupation'.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In which state would you find the gold depository at Fort Knox?","output":"The gold depository at Fort Knox, known officially as the United States Bullion Depository, is located in the state of Kentucky. To be more precise, it can be found in the small town of Fort Knox, which is near the city of Louisville and within the boundaries of the U.S. Army post Fort Knox. The town and the base both share the same name, making it relatively easy to remember where the depository resides. Established in 1936, the United States Bullion Depository was built with the intention of storing the nation's gold reserves securely. The facility is operated by the United States Department of the Treasury and plays a crucial role in safeguarding a significant portion of the country's gold holdings, as well as other precious items and important documents. The Fort Knox gold depository is an iconic symbol of national wealth, and it is widely renowned for its high level of security. It is set within a 109,000-acre military reservation, and it is surrounded by fences, alarms, and a multitude of security cameras. Moreover, the United States Mint Police, a federal law enforcement agency, is tasked with guarding the premises, ensuring that the vault remains impenetrable. The structure of the depository itself consists of a two-story granite and concrete fortress, with the exterior walls measuring 4 feet thick. The vault door, weighing around 20 tons, is made of blast-proof materials and secured by time locks, making it nearly impossible for unauthorized access. As of today, Fort Knox holds around 147.3 million ounces of gold, primarily in the form of gold bars. Aside from storing gold, the Fort Knox vault has also held other valuable artifacts and important documents at various points in history. For instance, during World War II, the depository safeguarded the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Magna Carta, amongst other priceless historical artifacts. It also served as a temporary storage site for the Crown of St. Stephen, a Hungarian relic, and the French crown jewels. In summary, the gold depository at Fort Knox is located in the state of Kentucky, near the city of Louisville and within the U.S. Army post Fort Knox. This high-security facility plays a vital role in safeguarding a significant portion of the nation's precious metals and other valuable items, making it an essential component of America's financial system."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following passage  \\"Early work in molecular genetics suggested the model that one gene makes one protein.

Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Question: Luke was a human. Like most humans, he learned from his parents.  He was mortal, but he could preserve himself by doing what? Options:  A. ocean  B. write  C. smile  D. die  E. think critically Answer:","output":"The most appropriate option to answer the question in line with common sense is option B. write. Luke, being a human, had a limited lifespan which made him mortal. However, throughout human history, individuals have found ways to preserve their thoughts, experiences, and knowledge by sharing them with others. One of the most effective ways of doing so is through writing. Writing can act as a powerful medium to communicate information, ideas, and emotions with others, transcending time and space limitations. As Luke learned from his parents, he could pass on his knowledge and experiences by writing them down in the form of stories, essays, or even personal reflections. This could be in physical form, like books, diaries, or articles, or any other textual format stored digitally, like blog posts, eBooks, or even social media updates. By sharing what he had learned and experienced, Luke can create a legacy that could potentially help, inspire, or teach others even after his death. His written contributions would remain as evidence of his existence, thoughts, and experiences – enabling him to preserve himself to some extent despite being mortal. In conclusion, option B. write is the most suitable answer in this context, as it best aligns with the concept of preserving oneself through the communication of one's knowledge and experiences for the benefit of future generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who spent most of his life in the United Kingdom?  Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

After they have gotten to the ticket counter, everyone is shocked that Snoopy was able to procure a First Class ticket, over their economy-class seats.During the plane flight, Charlie shows the letter that he received, which came from France. As Marcie has been studying French, she offers to translate it. The letter seems to be anticipating Charlie's arrival, and offers to allow him to stay at the Chateau Mal Voisin (\\"The Chateau of the Bad Neighbor\\"). The letter is from someone named Violette, but Charlie has no idea who she is.Their plane soon touches down in London, England, where the group has lunch, while Snoopy drives up to Wimbledon and plays a short tennis match.

When Charlie Brown, Linus, Snoopy, and Woodstock arrive at the chateau, they inadvertently become entangled in the efforts to save the chateau from a mysterious fire that breaks out, putting all the inhabitants in danger. Although Violette remains a somewhat enigmatic character throughout the film, it is evident that her intentions in inviting Charlie Brown and his friends were pure. She hoped that their presence would bring some happiness and light to the abandoned chateau. As the gang manages to put out the fire and save the chateau, Violette expresses her gratitude for their heroic actions.

Skywatchers have enjoyed spectacular views of this month's \\"supermoon\\" - when the Moon appears larger and brighter in the sky.      The supermoon phenomenon happens when the Moon reaches its closest point to Earth, known as a perigee Moon.      The Moon circuits the Earth in an elliptical or oval orbit - a supermoon occurs when the perigee Moon is also a full Moon.      The supermoon was the last opportunity to see one in 2017.      Image copyright SEAN QUINN Image caption The moon loomed above Yeadon, in Leeds      To observers, the Moon appears about 7% larger and 15% brighter, although the difference is barely noticeable to the human eye.      Last year the Moon made its closest approach to Earth since 1948 - it will not be that close again until 25 November 2034.      Nasa has called this weekend's sighting the first in a \\"supermoon trilogy\\" over the next two months, with others to come on 1 January and 31 January.      December's full Moon is traditionally known as the cold Moon.      The full Moon on Sunday afternoon - when it sits opposite the sun in the sky - was 222,761 miles from Earth, closer than its average 238,900 miles.      Image copyright Karli Franklin Image caption The supermoon over the Christmas light trail at Blenheim Palace      Image copyright Owen Humphreys/PA Image caption The supermoon has also been seen over a lighthouse in South Shields, South Tyneside.      This Moon's elliptical orbit means that its distance from Earth is not constant but varies across a full orbit.      But within this uneven orbit there are further variations caused by the Earth's movements around the Sun.      These mean that the perigee - the closest approach - and full moon are not always in sync.      But occasions when the perigee and full moon coincide have become known as supermoons.      Image copyright EPA Image caption The supermoon was visible around the world, with this view coming from Washington ||||| December's full moon rises tonight (Dec. 3), bringing the only \\"supermoon\\" of the year on its heels.      This month's full moon, known as the Full Cold Moon, peaks this morning, but will shine bright all night. The moon then reaches perigee — its closest point to Earth in a given orbit — early Monday (Dec. 4) at 3:45 a.m. EST (2045 GMT). Because the moon reaches perigee so close to the full moon, it's considered a supermoon — a full or near-full moon that can appear slightly larger in the sky than usual. You can watch a Slooh supermoon webcast online tonight at 9 p.m. EST (0100 GMT), courtesy of the online astronomy service Slooh, and watch directly from Slooh.com here.      While the moon's average distance from Earth is 238,000 miles (382,900 kilometers), its orbit isn't perfectly circular, so that distance varies a small amount. On Monday, when the moon reaches perigee, it will be 222,135 miles (357,492 km) away from Earth. It will reach apogee — its farthest distance from Earth in a given orbit — on Dec. 19 at 8:25 p.m. EST (0125 GMT on Dec. 20) — when it will be 252,651 miles (406,603 km) away.

That happened on May 25, when the moon was 221,958 miles (357,208 km) away from Earth. Not being full, the moon didn't count as a supermoon.      In New York City, the moon will reach peak fullness at 10:46 a.m. EST on Dec. 3. It will rise over the city a few hours earlier, at 4:59 p.m. Moonset will be the morning of Dec. 4 at 7:50 a.m. EST, according to timeanddate.com.      The moon will be in the constellation Taurus when it reaches peak fullness, so the supermoon will be near that constellation as well. On Sunday, the moon occults the star Aldebaran, so it will appear to the west of the star, north of the star Betelgeuse, which makes up the right shoulder of the constellation Orion (as viewed from the ground in the northern latitudes).      At the time of the supermoon, Mars will just be peeking over the horizon; it will be at a mere 5.5 degrees above the horizon in the southeastern sky for New Yorkers. The Red Planet rises at 3:16 a.m. EST, well before the sun rises at 7:03 EST, so it will be high enough for easy viewing (a half-hour before sunrise, it will be about 31 degrees above the horizon).

Speer and Murphy were once good friends, which changed after Murphy left the force.[1] On a rainy night, Speer comes to a diner for coffee. Two goons arrive, looking for Murphy. They pounce the minute Murphy arrives, starting a fistfight. Speer, no fan of Murphy's, ignores the fight until a goon causes him to spill his coffee. Both goons are thrown through the front door. Murphy sarcastically thanks Speer for saving his life. The two rivals have eyes for Murphy's secretary Addy (Jane Alexander). She loves both and proves it when, after tenderly kissing Murphy goodbye, goes on a date with Speer. Murphy does have a new romantic interest, a rich socialite named Caroline Howley (Madeline Kahn), but finds himself unable to commit. Speer and Addy go to a boxing match at which the mob boss Primo Pitt (Rip Torn) is present. Murphy's partner Dehl Swift (Richard Roundtree) is also there, and seems to be in cahoots with Pitt and his gang. Swift is in possession of a briefcase whose contents, secret accounting records of rival gang boss Leon Coll's operations, are the target of both Pitt's and Coll's gangs. Swift, tailed by Speer and Addy, is confronted by Pitt's thugs at his apartment with Ginny Lee (Irene Cara) taken hostage. Ginny Lee manages to escape but Swift is shot and killed during a struggle with Pitt.[1] A thug opens the briefcase but there's nothing inside. He picks up Swift's body and throws it out the window, where it lands on the roof of Speer's parked car (which is occupied by the horrified Addy, who waits after Speer goes to investigate in the apartment).

Background: Electrons can be removed from some objects using friction, simply by rubbing one substance against another substance. There are many examples of objects becoming charged by friction, including a rubber comb through hair, and a balloon on a sweater. In both these instances, the electrons move from the second object to the first, causing the first object to become negatively charged and the second one positively charged. Friction between the tires on a moving car and the road cause the tires to become charged, and wind causes friction between clouds and air which causes clouds to become charged and can result in tremendous bolts of lightning.  Paragraph: Two cities, Appleton and Orangeburg, are approximately 100 miles apart and are currently experiencing different weather. Appleton is windy and cloudy, but Orangeburg has very calm air but is also cloudy.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Are the clouds in Appleton positively or negatively charged?","output":"To answer the question, let's go through the information step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the context We are given information about how friction between objects can cause a transfer of electrons and change their charges. We have examples with a rubber comb, a balloon, car tires, and clouds. Step 2: Apply this knowledge to the scenario In the scenario, we have two cities, Appleton and Orangeburg, which both have clouds but different weather conditions. Appleton has windy and cloudy weather, while Orangeburg has calm air and is also cloudy. Step 3: Analyze the situation in Appleton Appleton is experiencing windy and cloudy weather. According to the background information, wind causes friction between clouds and air, which can result in charging the clouds.

Question: Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013).[17] Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.  Over the years, the town of Euphoria has grown more successful and wealthier than anyone ever thought. As the wealth has increased and people have acquired more material possessions, their outlook on life has become more positive and it has been noted that the citizens have a lower incidence of depression. The town of Zenphora, on the other hand, has taken a downward financial turn over the past 50 years. The citizens have had to sell their worldly goods just to make ends meet and many do not have a good feeling about what their future holds.  Which town is more optimistic, Euphoria or Zenphora? Answer:","output":"Euphoria is more optimistic than Zenphora. Step 1: Identify the factors that influence optimism in the towns. - In Euphoria, the factors are increasing wealth, more material possessions, a positive outlook on life, and a lower incidence of depression. - In Zenphora, the factors are a downward financial turn, selling worldly goods, and an uncertain feeling about the future. Step 2: Compare the factors in both towns. - Euphoria's factors are generally positive and contribute to a more optimistic outlook, while Zenphora's factors are mostly negative and would lead to a less optimistic outlook.

Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \\"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition.

The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition.

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to your friend's question is: John Lennon said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Earthquakes may happen anywhere on the earth. When some plates  of the earth move suddenly, an earthquake happens. Many earthquakes begin under the sea. They often happen near the mountains  , too. During an earthquake, the shakings make rocks rise suddenly and even crack  open. Houses fall, people are killed or hurt, and sometimes the whole villages or cities are destroyed . Can we do something to keep ourselves safe from earthquakes? Scientists have studied earthquakes and made maps that show the \\"earthquake belts\\". In areas in these belts, it's possible for earthquakes to happen. In these areas we should build strong houses to fight against   earthquakes. In the future, scientists will be able to tell when and where an earthquake will be before they happen. They can also tell people what to do and how to do it. A map showing the earthquake belts will tell people   _  .

The maps showing the \\"earthquake belts\\" provide information on areas that are prone to earthquakes due to being situated along or near the boundaries of Earth's tectonic plates. These zones, where earthquakes are most likely to occur, are known as earthquake belts. Therefore, these maps would tell people where earthquakes may occur.  However, they don't specify what kind of houses to build, or what kind of houses can withstand an earthquake. That information would come from construction guidelines and regulations in seismic zones, not the earthquake belt maps.

Question: I have a new situation: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work.  But I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  What is an answer for this question: Who is more at risk of experiencing hearing loss due to the sounds they encounter frequently? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the two individuals and their respective work environments. Jeremy works on a construction site with a jackhammer and large welding machine, while Alexander works in a library. Step 2: Understand the decibel levels they are exposed to. Jeremy is frequently exposed to high decibel levels, while Alexander is exposed to low decibel levels. Step 3: Recall the information on decibel levels and their effects. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater, and high-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause hearing loss. Step 4: Compare the two individuals' exposure to decibel levels. Jeremy, working on a construction site, is exposed to much higher decibel levels than Alexander, who works in a quiet library. Step 5: Identify who is more at risk for hearing loss.

Brendan Tevelin, 19, was brutally killed by a man who wanted revenge for American actions in the Mideast It has been three months since  college student Brendan Tevlin was brutally murdered in New Jersey by an extremist determined to get revenge for American military action in the Middle East. And every day since, his parents Michael and Allison have passed by the corner of Walker Road and Northfield Avenue in West Orange — the spot where their 19-year-old son lost his life. 'We have to pass it every day,' Allison Tevlin told The Star-Ledger. 'We saw all the flowers and the crosses. It was unnerving.' In an interview, the family tells","output":"the story of their struggle to cope with their devastating loss, and their determination to seek justice for their son. As the days turn into weeks, and then months, the Tevlin family finds strength in their love for each other and in the support of their community.  One day, a break in the case comes: the authorities arrest the man responsible for Brendan's murder. The man, identified as an extremist who acted alone, is found guilty in a court of law and sentenced to life in prison without parole. This brings at least a small measure of closure to the Tevlin family, who finally find that justice has been served. As the years go by, the Tevlin family decides to honor Brendan's memory and turn their pain into something positive. They establish a scholarship fund in Brendan's name to provide financial aid to deserving students in their community. Through their efforts, they find solace and a sense of purpose that helps them heal. The community never forgets the tragic event and continues to support the Tevlin family in their endeavors to keep Brendan's memory alive. In time, the story of Brendan Tevlin becomes one not only of pain and loss but also of hope and resilience. Together, the family, the community, and those who knew Brendan work tirelessly to ensure that his legacy of love, kindness, and service to others lives on. That corner of Walker Road and Northfield Avenue in West Orange, once a haunting reminder of the senseless tragedy, becomes a symbol of strength and unity in the face of adversity. The flowers and crosses at the site are replaced by a memorial bench, engraved with Brendan's name and a message about the goodwill and kindness he always displayed. Thus, Brendan Tevlin's story ends with a legacy of love and hope, inspiring the community to continue working together, supporting one another, and fighting against the forces of hatred and fear that claimed his life. And while the Tevlin family will never fully recover from their loss, their actions in his name bring light to the world and ensure that Brendan's memory will always endure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Soon after the US enters World War II, Steve Britt, a former World War I flying ace, arrives at Thunderbird Field, looking for a job as a civilian primary flight instructor. The base commander is an old friend, Lt. Col. \\"Mac\\" MacDonald, working with Squadron Leader Barrett (Reginald Denny, himself a World War I aerial observer), who is in charge of the Royal Air Force cadets at the base. Steve says he wants the job because he is too old for combat and the war will be won by pilots trained on bases like Thunderbird, but it is soon clear that he chose this base because his former girlfriend, Kay Saunders, lives nearby with her grandfather, retired Colonel Cyrus \\"Gramps\\" Saunders, also a close friend of Steve's. Steve immediately flies to their ranch and performs stunts over a water tank where Kay is bathing, blowing her robe away and then dropping her his flying coveralls.

In essence, people have been observed to adapt to levels of happiness or satisfaction when they achieve or possess something new, only to return to their baseline level of contentment before seeking more. Let's briefly explore the reasoning behind the other options: - Being happy: While receiving or attaining something new may initially bring happiness, people typically adapt to that state and seek additional sources of happiness.

He hides from the dog in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The tomcat hears the disembodied voice of a young girl (Drew Barrymore) pleading for help because something is threatening her. The cat is then captured by an employee from Quitters, Inc. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\"[edit] Cigarette smoker Dick Morrison (James Woods) is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc. to kick his habit. Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll.

Instead, the General finds himself entangled in different situations, crossing paths with various characters who all have their own individualized storylines and struggles. The movie is an anthology film, inspired by short stories written by Stephen King, and is comprised of three distinct segments: 1. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\" - This involves the story of Dick Morrison (played by James Woods) trying to quit smoking with the help of Quitters, Inc., an organization that inflicts severe punishments on its clients whenever they are caught smoking. 2. \\"The Ledge\\" - This story follows a man named Johnny Norris (played by Robert Hays), who is coerced by a crime boss into walking on the ledge of a high-rise building as a form of punishment for his infidelity. 3. \\"The General\\" - The final segment revolves around the cat, the General, who befriends a little girl named Amanda (played by Drew Barrymore) and ultimately protects her from a malevolent troll who wants to steal her breath and life force. Throughout the film, the General (the stray cat) serves as a connecting thread between these three stories. While the cat doesn't directly battle any antagonist throughout the film, it plays an essential role in saving and supporting the characters in their individual struggles."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Dan Savage prefers being 'monogamish' Today, our series By Design is taking on its most intimate project to date, looking at one of the most fundamental ways we design our lives... by day and by night. Keeping the passion alive in a long term relationship is a problem many couples face. We still live in a culture that idolizes marriage, and monogamy... but many couples struggle to keep their monogamous relationships vital. And with people living longer than ever, the idea of only having sex with one person for 5 or 6 decades can be daunting. Meanwhile, our culturally accepted ideas about sex and sexuality have undergone a seismic shift when it comes to many other issues. So, today we're asking whether the time has come to rethink — and possibly re-design — monogamy for the 21st Century. Dan Savage thinks so. He writes an internationally syndicated relationship and sex advice column called Savage Love. He is also host of a podcast called Savage Lovecast. And in 2010 he initiated the It Gets Better Project with his husband, Terry Miller. Robin Rinaldi became something of an expert in non-monogamy, after her own, year-long experiment with re-designing her relationship. She wrote about her experiences in her book, \\"The Wild Oats Project: One Woman's Midlife Quest for Passion at Any Cost.\\" Does this concept of monogamish resonate for you? Have you felt a desire to re-invent, or re-design, your relationship? If you have an experience you can share, e-mail us or tweet us @thecurrentcbc, with #bydesigncbc. This segment was produced by The Current's Kristin Nelson.

Math Problem Solve 0*x + x - 3 = 0 for x.","output":"To solve this equation, you'll need to simplify it first, and then isolate the variable x on one side of the equation.  First, let's start with the equation you have: 0*x + x - 3 = 0  The term 0*x is equal to 0 (since anything multiplied by 0 is 0), so you can take it out from the equation without affecting the validity of the equation. Also, you can combine like terms. So this equation simplifies to: x - 3 = 0 Now, isolate the x: To isolate x, all you need to do is get rid of the -3 on the left side of the equation. You can do this by applying the inverse operation: addition.  If you add 3 to both sides of the equation (maintaining the equality), -3 and +3 will cancel each other out on the left side: x - 3 + 3 = 0 + 3 Simplify both sides of the equation: x = 3 Therefore, the solution to the original equation 0*x + x - 3 = 0 is x equals 3.

I learned that lesson when, as a child, I ran into a beehive. Dozens of bees attacked, stinging me all over my body. It was a painful incident, but I was lucky. Those bees weren't Africanized, or \\"killer\\" bees. Killer bees are extremely aggressive . When they become upset, they attack. And just about anything like noises, shiny objects, dark clothes can all cause killer bees to attack. When one killer bee stings a victim, it gives off a chemical. Other bees smell this and go into attack mode. The whole hive will aggressively attack the unfortunate victim. Killer bees will also run their victims for up to a quarter of a mile. Some victims have tried to keep away from the bees by jumping into water. But killer bees will wait for them to come up and then continue their attack. Killer bees can be found in South America and the southern prefix = st1 /United States. They were created when, in 1956, scientists brought African bees toBrazil. African bees were known to increase coffee production. Some scientists thought that these bees might increase honey production, too. So inBrazil, they tried crossbreeding the African bees with European honeybees. The results were _  The new Africanized bees actually decreased honey production and were very aggressive. Scientists tried to separate the bees, but some of them escaped and began rapidly spreading north. Since then, killer bees have been causing damage to humans, animals and the American honey industry. Over the years, these aggressive killer bees have caused nearly 10,000 people to die. What's the best thing to do if you are attacked by killer bees? Fortunately, killer bees don't fly very fast. Most healthy adults can outrun them. Experts advise you to cover your face and run! We can infer from the passage that   _  . A) killer bees will take the place of European bees before long B) killer bees are sure to increase the production of coffee C) it is difficult to get rid of killer bees D) killer bees have caused great harm to the people there","output":"It is indeed true that most people are afraid of bees, primarily because of the painful experience of getting stung. Your unfortunate encounter with a beehive as a child illustrates how traumatic such experiences can be, and it instills a level of caution regarding bees. However, it is important to differentiate between the regular bee species and the more aggressive Africanized or \\"killer\\" bees. Killer bees, as you mentioned, have a heightened level of aggression and attack even when exposed to seemingly harmless triggers like noises, shiny objects, or dark clothing. Due to their stinging mechanism and the release of a chemical that signals other bees to attack, being the target of a killer bee swarm attack can be extremely dangerous, and sometimes even fatal. This aggressive behavior has earned them their fearsome name. It is unfortunate that killer bees were inadvertently created in 1956 when scientists tried to crossbreed African bees with European honeybees in Brazil. The intention was to boost honey production, but the result turned out to be the aggressive, Africanized bees with decreased honey production. The spread of killer bees into South America and the southern United States has had adverse effects on not only humans and animals but also the American honey industry. With nearly 10,000 deaths attributed to them, it is evident that they pose a significant threat to people and animals in the regions where they are found. From the passage, we can infer that (C) it is difficult to get rid of killer bees, and (D) killer bees have caused great harm to the people in the affected areas. Although these bees were initially brought to increase coffee production, there is no mention in the passage indicating that killer bees are sure to increase coffee production in the future. Additionally, the passage does not suggest that killer bees will replace European bees in the long run. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you are being attacked by killer bees, the best course of action is to cover your face and run, as they do not fly very fast, and most healthy adults can outrun them. The key is to remain vigilant and act quickly to minimize the risk of harm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Willie is not so certain about that, but is too shrewd to have Steve killed out of hand by his bodyguard, whom he jokingly calls his \\"Adopted Son\\" (Robert McWade). It turns out that he had cause for concern; Steve persuades Belle to marry him. Deeply in love with Belle himself and still hoping to get her back, Willie lets Steve live. Steve quickly rises through the boxing ranks. However, he cannot keep from fooling around with other women. When Belle catches him in a lie, she tells him that she loves him, but if he cheats on her once more, she will leave him. While waiting for a bout for the heavyweight championship of the world, Steve performs in a musical revue. When Belle unexpectedly goes to his dressing room, she finds a woman hiding there. It is the end of their marriage. She gets her old job back with Willie. Anxious to see the overconfident Steve humiliated, Willie finds out what is holding up the match with the current champion, Primo Carnera (playing himself), and pays 25,000 to set it up.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \\"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\\" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \\"the weakest in the history of the world.\\" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \\"Angel Families,\\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. \\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \\"We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children. According to the above context, answer the following question. President Trump's vow to end Immigration Crisis will probably take: Answer:","output":"The text does not provide a specific timeframe in which President Trump plans to \\"end the Immigration Crisis.\\" It's clear that President Trump is committed to taking a tough stance on immigration, expressing that he sees the U.S.'s immigration laws as some of \\"the weakest in the history of the world\\" and asserting that increased border security is paramount in creating a safer country. However, the complexity of immigration issues, combined with political, legal, and humanitarian considerations, means that substantial changes to immigration policies and their effects could take considerable time. For instance, the implementation of Trump's \\"zero tolerance\\" policy, which led to the separation of children from their parents upon illegal entry, sparked widespread domestic and international criticism. In response, President Trump signed an order ending this practice, and this single component of his broader immigration strategy itself took time and adjustment. Furthermore, changing immigration law involves legislation, which must be passed by Congress and can be a lengthy, unpredictable process due to negotiations and political differences. Enforcing new policies also requires resources, training, and time for implementation.  Lastly, it's important to factor in legal challenges to new immigration policies, which can slow down or block a policy’s rollout. Various groups and states often litigate controversial policies, and this can introduce further delays.  So, while President Trump's dedication to addressing what he views as an immigration crisis is evident, predicting exact 'end' to it is complex and not defined in the text supplied. It’s critical to consider the multitude of factors involved, the legislative and legal processes required, and potentially fluctuating public and political opinion."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This moment is often characterized by a sense of finality, as the person faces the reality of their own mortality. The most suitable term to describe what awaits them soon is expiration. Expiration, in this context, refers to the process of dying or passing away. It is an inevitable part of the life cycle that every living being must experience. As a person nears the end of their life, their body begins to shut down; their organs start to fail, and their bodily functions gradually cease to operate effectively. Several factors can contribute to a person's expiration, including illness, age, injuries, or chronic health conditions. In some cases, individuals may be able to control or manage the circumstances leading to their death, such as seeking medical treatment or engaging in preventative care measures. However, in many instances, death is simply an unavoidable outcome of the natural aging process or an unforeseen event. During this time, the person on the death bed might experience many emotions, such as fear, sadness, or even peace and acceptance. Family members and loved ones may gather around to provide support and comfort, sharing stories, reminiscing, and celebrating the individual's life. As the person on their death bed moves closer to expiration, they may exhibit certain signs and symptoms that indicate their body is shutting down. This can include shallow breaths, irregular heartbeat, decreased appetite, and changes in consciousness. Eventually, the person will take their last breath, marking the end of their life. In conclusion, while the options provided each relate to some aspect of human experience, expiration is the most suitable term to answer the question. As the person on their death bed approaches the end of their life, they will soon experience this natural process and complete their journey on this earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Willie Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas on April 29, 1933, during the Great Depression, to Myrle Marie (nee Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson. He was born on April 29, but his birth was recorded by doctor F. D. Sims on April 30. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work. Willie Nelson has married four times and fathered seven children. His first marriage was to Martha Matthews; it lasted from 1952 to 1962. The couple had three children: Lana, Susie and Willie \\"Billy\\" Hugh, Jr. Billy died by suicide in 1991. The marriage was marked by violence, with Matthews assaulting Nelson several times, including one incident when she sewed him up in a bed sheet and then beat him with a broomstick. Nelson's next marriage was to Shirley Collie in 1963. The couple divorced in 1971, after Collie found a bill from the maternity ward of a Houston hospital charged to Nelson and Connie Koepke for the birth of Paula Carlene Nelson. Koepke and Nelson married the same year, then had another daughter, Amy Lee Nelson. Following a divorce in 1988, he married his current wife, Annie D'Angelo, in 1991. They have two sons, Lukas Autry and Jacob Micah. Nelson traces his genealogy to the American Revolutionary War, in which his ancestor John Nelson served as a major.  Nelson owns Luck, Texas, a ranch in Spicewood, Texas, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors.While swimming in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's lung collapsed. He was taken to the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.  During his childhood, Nelson grew interested in martial arts. He ordered self-defense manuals on jujitsu and judo that he saw advertised in Batman and Superman comic books. Nelson started to formally practice kung fu after he moved to Nashville, in the 1960s. During the 1980s, Nelson began training in tae kwon do and now holds a second-degree black belt in that discipline. During the 1990s, Nelson started to practice the Korean martial art GongKwon Yusul. In 2014, after twenty years in the discipline, his Grand Master Sam Um presented him with a fifth-degree black belt in a ceremony held in Austin, Texas. A 2014 Tae Kwon Do Times magazine interview revealed that Nelson had developed an unorthodox manner of training during the lengthy periods of time he was on tour. Nelson would conduct his martial arts training on his tour bus \\"The Honeysuckle Rose\\" and send videos to his supervising Master for review and critique.

And it’s hard to quarrel with Mr. Smith’s overriding message: Wall Street should put clients interests’ first or risk oblivion. Indeed, that was Goldman Sachs’s own credo, “Our clients’ interests always come first.” But stripped of its incendiary conclusions, Mr. Smith’s manifesto was curiously short on facts. Other than the now-infamous reference to muppets — “I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as ‘muppets,’ sometimes over internal e-mail” — there were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off. Mr. Smith declined to elaborate after the article was published, heightening suspense and no doubt fueling the literary bidding that reached a reported 1.5 million for a book that would deliver the goods. That book, “Why I Left Goldman Sachs,” goes on sale on Monday. Despite tight security, copies of the book have been circulating, and I read one. The book not only fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions, but he admits changing “names or descriptors” for some (but not all) people and acknowledges that what he does disclose is “from memory.” He says he has tried “to retain the spirit” of what actually occurred. This makes it nearly impossible to verify much of what he says. Beyond that, from his perch on the equity trading desk he seems to have had a narrow view of the institution where he worked for nearly 12 years. His disillusionment comes across as heartfelt, but much of it seems to have come less from his own experiences than from news reports about the firm’s behavior in deals he wasn’t involved in. Mr. Smith’s book might even bolster Goldman’s reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets — Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman — then he hasn’t made much of a case. But Mr. Smith isn’t in much of a position to exonerate Goldman, either. The firm was deeply enmeshed in nearly all aspects of the financial crisis and its causes, including mortgage-backed securities. And after an injection of taxpayer support, it managed to profit handsomely and pay the lavish bonuses that Mr. Smith shared in. But you won’t find that story in “Why I Left.” Mr. Smith declined to discuss any of this before his scheduled appearance on Sunday on “60 Minutes.” Goldman Sachs responded to some of my questions with copies of parts of their internal investigation and made several employees available. Potential problems with Mr. Smith’s approach surface almost immediately. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 describes “an intern named Josh” who’s being “grilled” and asked to explain risk arbitrage but “was floundering badly.” Josh, Mr. Smith adds, is the son of a billionaire. There was no “Josh” in Mr. Smith’s group of interns, and only one son of a billionaire: Teddy Schwarzman, son of Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive of the asset management firm Blackstone Group. “I was never grilled on risk arbitrage, or asked to give a presentation on it,” Mr. Schwarzman said when I contacted him this week. “I realize it was a long time ago, but I would certainly have remembered it if I had floundered.” Nor did anyone else in the class I spoke to recall such an episode. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about a man named Greg Smith who used to work at a big company called Goldman Sachs. He left the company and wrote a letter in a newspaper called The New York Times, saying that the company was not very nice and treated their customers badly. He then wrote a book called \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs,\\" where people thought he would give more details about the bad things he saw at the company. The article says that the book doesn't really give a lot of examples and it's hard to know if what he says is true.

Chatfield remains in the hospital after the incident, indicating the severity of his injuries. This may evoke sympathy from readers and could be seen as a negative point in the narrative concerning Albert Chatfield. 4. The police claimed that Chatfield assumed a \\"fighting stance,\\" but the video shows him backing away instead. This contradiction could be seen as undermining the police's account, which may be perceived as negative for Chatfield. 5. The lawyer blames the incident on a mental issue and mentions that the settlement money will be used for Chatfield's medical expenses. This again generates sympathy and places Chatfield in a vulnerable position, which may be seen as negative. Overall, the sentiment in the document towards Albert Chatfield is mostly negative or at least sympathetic towards his situation rather than neutral. It portrays the police actions as wrongdoing and emphasizes Chatfield's vulnerability and injuries. Output: No"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The hijackers attacked at 9:28. While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.  Question: \\"How much time passed between the 1st radio mayday transmission and the second?\\" Answer: \\"two minutes\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Available options: (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"1. no The correct answer is \\"no\\" because the text states that the second radio transmission happened 35 seconds after the first one, not two minutes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of  Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Government\\" correctly answer the question \\"What different possible funding sources for  Bin Laden were considered?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Government\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What different possible funding sources for Bin Laden were considered?\\" Based on the paragraph, the different possible funding sources considered for Bin Laden were his personal fortune, charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators.

If It was a center of power in the seventh century b.c. when the Samians were the leading maritime nation on the Aegean., can we conclude that \\"When the Samians were leading maritime nation on the Aegean it was the center of Power\\"?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"When the Samians were the leading maritime nation on the Aegean, it was the center of power,\\" taking into account the provided historical context and the various factors that contributed to the Samians' rise as a maritime power in the seventh century BC.  Ancient Samos, an island in the eastern Aegean Sea, played a significant role in the region during the seventh century BC. There are several reasons to suggest that when the Samians were the leading maritime nation on the Aegean, they indeed held substantial power and influence in the region. 1. Strong Economy: With its success in maritime activity, Samos developed a robust economy during this time. The island prospered through trade and commerce, giving them considerable financial clout. This trade success was made possible by the Samians' skilled shipbuilding techniques and navigation knowledge, which contributed to them becoming the leading maritime nation on the Aegean. 2. Political Influence: As the Samians grew in prominence as a maritime power, they established alliances and exerted political influence throughout the Aegean region. Samians participated in the affairs of other city-states, intervening in political disputes, and sometimes offering military support. In the seventh century BC, this political influence contributed to their status as a center of power. 3. Cultural Developments: Samos was home to several essential architectural and artistic accomplishments during this time. The Heraion of Samos, for example, was a significant religious sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Hera and was considered one of the most impressive structures in the ancient Greek world. Furthermore, the island was also the birthplace of renowned philosopher Pythagoras. Such cultural advancements enhanced the island's reputation as a center of power and progress. 4. Military Strength: The maritime dominance of Samos meant that it also possessed a formidable naval force during the seventh century BC. The military power of the Samians allowed them to exert control and influence over the Aegean and protect their interests against rival city-states. 5. Geographical Advantage: Samos is strategically located in the eastern Aegean Sea, close to the coast of Asia Minor. This advantageous geographical position enabled Samos to engage in trade across both the Aegean and the Mediterranean, further cementing its status as a leading maritime nation. In conclusion, when the Samians were the leading maritime nation on the Aegean in the seventh century BC, they could indeed be considered a center of power. They achieved this through their strong economy, political influence, cultural accomplishments, military strength, and geographical advantages that elevated Samos to prominence during this period."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - The peso (meaning \\"weight\\" in Spanish, or more loosely \\"pound\\") was a coin that originated in Spain and became of immense importance internationally. \\"Peso\\" is now the name of the monetary unit of several former Spanish colonies.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.  - Mestizo (Peninsular Spanish: , Latin American Spanish, Philippine Spanish: ) is a term traditionally used in Spain and Spanish America to mean a person of combined European and Amerindian descent, or someone who would have been deemed a Castizo (one European parent and one Mestizo parent) regardless if the person was born in Latin America or elsewhere. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the casta system that was in use during the Spanish Empire's control of their New World colonies. Mestizos are usually considered to be mixed Spaniards by the crown of Spain.  - Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money.  - A medium of exchange is an intermediary used in trade to avoid the inconveniences of a pure barter system.  - A coin is a small, flat, round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender.

This includes all aspects of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. In terms of volume of trading, it is by far the largest market in the world, followed by the Credit market. The main participants in this market are the larger international banks. Financial centres around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market does not determine the relative values of different currencies, but sets the current market price of the value of one currency as demanded against another.  - A banknote (often known as a bill, paper money, or simply a note) is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, who were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank. Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks.  - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins.

This undated colorized transmission electron micrograph image made available by the CDC shows an Ebola virus virion. For the first time, Ebola has been discovered inside the eyes of a patient months after... (Associated Press)      Ebola has infected more than 26,000 people since December 2013 in West Africa. Some survivors have reported eye problems but how often they occur isn't known. The virus also is thought to be able to persist in semen for several months.      The new report concerns Dr. Ian Crozier, a 43-year-old American physician diagnosed with Ebola in September while working with the World Health Organization in Sierra Leone.      He was treated at Emory University Hospital's special Ebola unit in Atlanta and released in October when Ebola was no longer detected in his blood. Two months later, he developed an inflammation and very high blood pressure in one eye, which causes swelling and potentially serious vision problems.      He returned to Emory, where ophthalmologist Dr. Steven Yeh drained some of the fluid and had it tested for Ebola. It contained the virus but tears and tissue around the outside of his eye did not.      That suggests that casual contact with an Ebola survivor poses no public health risk, but shows that survivors need to be monitored for the eye problem, Yeh said.      Crozier has not fully recovered his vision but continues to improve, Yeh said.      Dr. Jay Varkey, an Emory infectious disease specialist, said those involved in Crozier's care wore recommended protective gear and monitored themselves for Ebola symptoms for several weeks afterward as a precaution.      Doctors discussed the case at an Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology conference in Denver on Thursday, and the New England Journal of Medicine published their account online.      Earlier Thursday, the World Health Organization said that the number of Ebola cases reported in Guinea and Sierra Leone last week dropped to its lowest total this year. And Liberia, which has had the most deaths in the outbreak — more than 4,700 — plans on Saturday to declare the outbreak over in that country unless new cases are discovered.      ___      Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP ||||| A previously healthy 43-year-old male physician received a diagnosis of EVD on September 6, 2014, while he was working in an Ebola treatment unit in Kenema, Sierra Leone. He was transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and arrived 4 days after the onset of symptoms. He was treated with an experimental small interfering RNA antiviral agent (TKM-100802, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals), convalescent plasma, and aggressive supportive care.5      The hospital course was complicated by multiorgan system failure requiring mechanical ventilation for 12 days and hemodialysis for 24 days.6 After extubation, the patient had altered mental status, difficulty walking related to severe proximal weakness and deconditioning, and extreme fatigue. On day 44 of the illness, hemodialysis was no longer required and his mental status had markedly improved, with some residual mild word-finding difficulty. Ambulation was limited to short distances because of exertional fatigue. Blood and urine tested negative for EBOV on quantitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay on serial specimens, and he was discharged home. A semen sample obtained on the day of discharge was positive for EBOV RNA on quantitative RT-PCR assay, and EBOV was isolated from semen by means of culture at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).7 The patient was advised to abstain from sex or to use condoms for at least 3 months.8 Longitudinal monitoring of semen specimens for EBOV is ongoing.      After discharge, 10 weeks after the onset of EVD symptoms, the patient’s word-finding difficulty and exercise tolerance were markedly improved, but he had new symptoms, including low back pain involving the right lumbar and sacroiliac region, bilateral enthesitis of the Achilles’ tendon, and paresthesias involving the distal lower limbs. Ophthalmic symptoms, which began shortly after discharge from the hospital, included occasional bilateral ocular burning, foreign-body sensation, and photophobia. He required an adjustment in his prescription for reading glasses, which suggested an accommodative change. His ocular history was clinically significant only for myopia. He was referred to the Emory Eye Center for further evaluation.      Figure 1. Figure 1. Montage Fundus Photographs 10 Weeks after the Onset of Ebola Virus Disease. Multiple peripheral chorioretinal scars with hypopigmented haloes are visible in the right eye (Panel A) and left eye (Panel B) (white arrows). A small intraretinal hemorrhage (black arrow) is adjacent to a chorioretinal scar in the left eye.      On initial evaluation in November 2014, the patient’s visual acuity was 20/15 bilaterally while wearing eyeglasses. Intraocular pressure, pupils, ocular motility, and confrontational visual fields were normal. The examination of the anterior eye by means of slit lamp was normal. The examination of the dilated posterior eye revealed previously undocumented multiple, peripheral chorioretinal scars with hypopigmented halos in both eyes and a small intraretinal hemorrhage adjacent to one scar in the left eye (Figure 1). He received the diagnosis of posterior uveitis (i.e., chorioretinitis), a likely sequela of EVD. Close clinical follow-up was planned.      Figure 2. Figure 2. Slit-Lamp Photograph of the Left Eye 14 Weeks after the Onset of Ebola Virus Disease. Mild corneal edema, rare keratic precipitates (arrows), and inflammatory cells and protein in the anterior chamber are consistent with acute anterior uveitis.      One month later, 14 weeks after the diagnosis of EVD, he presented with an acute onset of redness, blurred vision with halos, pain, and photophobia in the left eye. Visual acuity was measured at 20/15 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. The left intraocular pressure was highly elevated at 44 mm Hg (normal value, 10 to 21). Slit-lamp examination of the left eye showed conjunctival injection, mild corneal edema, rare nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and grade 1+ leukocytes and protein (flare) in the anterior chamber (Figure 2). Examination of the anterior chamber with gonioscopy indicated no signs of angle closure. Dilated funduscopic examination showed stable chorioretinal scars in both eyes with no other signs of ocular inflammation. He received a diagnosis of anterior uveitis and ocular hypertension in the left eye. Treatment was started with eyedrops containing 1% prednisolone acetate four times daily and with ocular hypotensive agents including acetazolamide (at a dose of 500 mg orally twice daily), eyedrops containing 0.2% brimonidine twice daily, and eyedrops containing 2% dorzolamide and 0.5% timolol twice daily. Results of laboratory testing, including measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, were normal; rapid plasma reagin testing and serologic analysis for Toxoplasma gondii were negative.      Because of escalating anterior-chamber inflammation and worsening symptoms during the subsequent 48 hours, the frequency of administration of prednisolone acetate was increased to every 2 hours, and eyedrops containing 1% atropine twice daily were added. After another 24 hours of increasing inflammation and concern about an infectious cause, paracentesis of the anterior chamber was performed, with aspiration of 170 μl of aqueous humor through a sterile 30-gauge needle while the practitioner was wearing gloves and a surgical mask. The specimen was double-bagged and delivered to a dedicated laboratory at Emory University Hospital for testing samples from patients with EVD. Testing was performed by clinical laboratory technologists who were trained in the safe handling of infectious pathogens and with the use of the standard institutional operating protocols.9 The aqueous humor tested positive for EBOV RNA on quantitative RT-PCR assay, with a cycle threshold value of 18.7. EBOV was isolated from this specimen by means of a viral culture performed at the CDC.7 A conjunctival swab obtained before the procedure and tear-film specimens collected before the procedure and 24 hours after the procedure tested negative for EBOV RNA on quantitative RT-PCR assay. In addition, a specimen of peripheral blood tested negative for EBOV RNA on quantitative RT-PCR assay. Preliminary analyses of EBOV sequenced from blood during the patient’s hospitalization for symptomatic EVD, as compared with EBOV sequenced from ocular fluid, identified a single nonsynonymous mutation, as well as two silent mutations and two mutations in noncoding regions. The significance of these mutations is unknown. However, these findings are in contrast to results that showed no changes in viral consensus sequences acquired over several days from a single patient.10 All personal protective equipment and materials that were used during paracentesis and laboratory testing were sterilized by means of autoclaving before disposal.11      The uveitis continued to progress; by 5 days after the onset of symptoms, visual acuity in the left eye was decreased to 20/60. Anterior-segment examination revealed scleritis and persistent anterior uveitis. Intermediate uveitis (i.e., vitritis, with grade 0.5+ haze) was noted on examination of the dilated posterior segment. Oral prednisone (at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) was started. Ophthalmic drops of 1% prednisolone acetate every 2 hours, 0.5% timolol twice daily, and 1% atropine twice daily were continued in the left eye.      Figure 3. Figure 3. Fundus Photograph of the Left Eye 14 Weeks after the Onset of Ebola Virus Disease. Severe vitritis is indicated by the obscuration of the optic nerve and blood vessels.      During the subsequent 72 hours, the patient’s condition improved, with resolution of the scleritis and a decrease in the anterior uveitis. Despite this improvement in the anterior-segment inflammation, the vitritis worsened, resulting in a decrease in visual acuity to 20/400 in the left eye at 1 week (Figure 3). Continued clinical deterioration of the patient’s left eye prompted the initiation of treatment with topical difluprednate (Alcon Laboratories), a 21-day course of oral favipiravir (MediVector), a periocular injection of triamcinolone, and a 10-week tapering course of oral prednisone. On examination 3 months after presentation with uveitis, the vitritis was resolving and left visual acuity had recovered to 20/15. Follow-up ophthalmic evaluations are ongoing. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A patient had the Ebola virus and got better after doctors treated him.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Puberty in girls starts when the hypothalamus “tells” the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the ovaries. Two pituitary hormones are involved: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) . These hormones stimulate the ovary to produce estrogen . Estrogen, in turn, promotes growth and other physical changes of puberty. It stimulates growth and development of the internal reproductive organs, breasts, and pubic hair (see Figure below ). You can watch an animation of these and other changes that girls experience during puberty at this link: http://www. bbc. co. uk/science/humanbody/body/interactives/lifecycle/teenagers/ .   Q: What item starts puberty in girls?   A: Answer:","output":"The hypothalamus starts puberty in girls.  Step 1: Read and understand the given paragraph. The paragraph provides information about puberty in girls, specifically mentioning the role of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, hormones, and ovaries.

A medal may be awarded to a person or organization as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, academic, or various other achievements. Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient.  - A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture.  - Hancock is a city in Houghton County, Michigan, United States and is located on Copper Island, which is part of the Keweenaw Peninsula, on the Keewenaw Waterway directly opposite Houghton, Michigan.

Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so from 1956 to 1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US80,000,000. It was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues. Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events. Women's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue, so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning twenty-one medals, seven of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova won two gold medals each.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert the sun's energy into chemical energy. The series of reactions used to do this conversion (referred to collectively as photosynthesis) creates molecular oxygen, o. this oxygen, which is critical for all other life on the planet, is released into the atmosphere.","output":"Photosynthesis is a unique biological process that allows plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in the form of glucose or other sugar molecules. This stored chemical energy is then used to fuel the organism's activities, such as growth and reproduction. In addition to providing the organism with energy, photosynthesis also plays an essential role in the global carbon and oxygen cycles by removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and releasing oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. The process of photosynthesis can be broadly divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle. These reactions occur within a specialized structure in plant cells called the chloroplast, which contains pigments called chlorophyll that are responsible for capturing light energy. 1. Light-dependent reactions The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and are initiated when light photons are absorbed by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments. This absorption of light excites electrons within the molecules, boosting them to higher energy levels. Photosynthetic organisms have specialized proteins called reaction centers that can capture these high-energy electrons. In plants, there are two types of reaction centers known as Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII). These photosystems work together in a series of electron-transfer reactions known as the Z-scheme, which forms the basis of light-dependent reactions. When the excited electrons from PSII are harvested, they are transferred to the primary electron acceptor and then passed along a series of molecules in the electron transport chain. This process releases energy, which is used to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton gradient. Simultaneously, PSII replenishes its lost electrons by splitting water molecules in a process called photolysis. This is the source of molecular oxygen (O2) that is released as waste during photosynthesis. The overall equation for photolysis is: 2H2O → 4H+ + 4e- + O2 The oxygen molecules produced diffuse out of the chloroplast and eventually out of the plant, contributing to the atmospheric oxygen levels essential for aerobic respiration in other organisms. 2. Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) While the light-dependent reactions occur only in the presence of light, the light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle, can happen in either light or dark conditions. The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma of the chloroplast and involves the fixation of carbon dioxide into an organic molecule. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), which is considered the most abundant enzyme on Earth. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with the 5-carbon molecule ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), forming two 3-carbon molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. These molecules are then converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can either be used to synthesize glucose or regenerate RuBP. The production of glucose occurs through a series of enzymatic reactions, and glucose can then be converted into other sugars, starches, or cellulose, depending on the plant's needs. In summary, photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy while also producing oxygen as a byproduct. The process is divided into light-dependent reactions, in which light energy is captured and used to generate ATP and NADPH, and light-independent reactions, where carbon dioxide is fixed into an organic molecule through the Calvin cycle. The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere, providing the necessary element for life on Earth to thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses.

Choices:  - tissues  - Chest  - lungs  - pelvis  A: A:","output":"The body structure designed to support the weight of the upper body when sitting and transfer this weight to the lower limbs when standing is the pelvis. The pelvis consists of four bones: right and left hip bones (also known as the ilium, ischium, and pubis), sacrum, and coccyx. The pelvis is a complex and critical anatomical structure that plays a vital role in multiple bodily functions. Besides supporting the weight of the upper body and providing stability for the spine, it also houses and protects various organs within the pelvic cavity, such as the urinary bladder, reproductive organs, and the lower part of the digestive system. The right and left hip bones, also known as innominate bones, form the lateral and anterior walls of the pelvic cavity. Each hip bone is made up of three fused bones: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. The ilium is the uppermost and the largest part of the hip bone, responsible for the flare of the hips. The ischium is the posterior and lowest part of the hip bone that provides support when sitting. The pubis is the anterior portion, and the two pubic bones meet at the midline in a joint called the pubic symphysis. The sacrum, a large, triangular bone at the base of the spine, is formed by the fusion of five sacral vertebrae. It is wedged between the two hip bones, connecting the spine to the pelvis. The sacrum provides strength and stability to the spine and transmits the weight of the upper body to the hip bones. The coccyx, commonly known as the tailbone, is a small, triangular bone located at the very end of the vertebral column. It is comprised of three to five fused coccygeal vertebrae and serves as an attachment site for various muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Although the coccyx does not play a direct role in weight-bearing, it is an important part of the overall pelvic structure and contributes to the stability and balance of the body. In conclusion, the pelvis, with its four bones (right and left hip bones, sacrum, and coccyx), is an essential body structure that supports the weight of the upper body when sitting and transfers this weight to the lower limbs when standing. Not only does it provide stability and balance, but it also houses and protects vital organs within the pelvic cavity, making it a critical component of the human skeletal system."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the King, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but his pleas fall on deaf ears.The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil. The Counsel Members tries to have him killed during a hunting trip, resulting in the death of one of the members of the street performing team. Days after the hunting trip, there is a kiss between the king and Gong-gil. Then, she... My question: what is the group arrested for? The answer is:","output":"The group is arrested for treason due to performing a skit mocking members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine, Jang Noksu.

During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.  Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.  Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him.

Article: In the first eight months of his pontificate, Pope Francis has impressed, charmed and inspired many people around the world with his outreach to non-Christians, his statements of concern for the poor and disabled, and his personal humility. At the same time, other Catholics have expressed dismay over the pope’s statements about homosexuality and his remarks that the church is “obsessed” with some social issues.      Some news accounts contend that the pope’s popularity has created a “Pope Francis effect,” producing a “significant global rise in church attendance,” based on reports by Catholic clergy in Italy, Britain and and other countries of a recent rise in Mass attendance.      In the United States, home to the world’s fourth-largest Catholic population, the pope appears to be well-liked by Catholics and non-Catholics alike, rated favorably by 79% of Catholics and 58% of the general public.      But has the pope’s popularity produced a Catholic resurgence in the U.S., where 10% of adults are former Catholics ? Not so far, at least in terms of the share of Americans who identify as such, or the share of those who report attending Mass weekly.      A new analysis of pooled Pew Research surveys conducted between Francis’ election in March and the end of October this year finds that the percentage of Americans who identify as Catholics has remained the same – 22% — as it was during the corresponding seven-month period in 2012. In fact, our polls going back to 2007 show Catholic identification in the U.S. has held stable, fluctuating only between 22% and 23%.      Though Americans may report attending church more frequently than they actually do, our surveys find that self-reported levels of Mass attendance have remained virtually unchanged since the new pope was elected. Since April of this year, 39% of U.S. Catholics report attending Mass at least weekly, similar to the 40% attendance figure last year. ||||| 2013-11-26 Vatican Radio      (Vatican Radio) Pope Francis has issued his first Apostolic Exhortation on Tuesday,, translated into English as The Joy of the Gospel. The 224-page document outlines the Pope’s vision for a missionary Church, whose “doors should always be open”. The Pope speaks on numerous themes, including evangelization, peace, homiletics, social justice, the family, respect for creation, faith and politics, ecumenism, interreligious dialogue, and the role of women and of the laity in the Church.The Joy of the Gospel is the title Pope Francis has chosen for this first major document of his pontificate, putting down in print the joyous spirit of encounter with Christ that characterizes every public appearance he has made so far. The man who has constantly kept the media’s attention with his desire to embrace and share his faith with everyone he meets, now urgesto do exactly the same. To “recover the original freshness of the Gospel”, as he puts it, through a thorough renewal of the Church’s structures and vision. Including what he calls “a conversion of the papacy” to make it better able to serve the mission of evangelization in the modern world. The Church, he says, should not be afraid to re-examine “customs not directly connected to the heart of the Gospel” even if they may have deep historical roots.In strikingly direct and personal language, the Pope appeals to all Christians to bring about a “revolution of tenderness” by opening their hearts each day to God’s unfailing love and forgiveness. The great danger in today’s consumer society, he says, is “the desolation and anguish” that comes from a “covetous heart, the feverish pursuit of frivolous pleasures, and a blunted conscience.” Whenever our interior life becomes caught up in its own interests , he warns, “there is no longer room for others, no place for the poor.”As we open our hearts, the Pope goes on, so the doors of our churches must always be open and the sacraments available to all. The Eucharist, he says pointedly, “is not a prize for the perfect, but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak” And he repeats his ideal of a Church that is “bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets” rather than a Church that is caught up in a slavish preoccupation with liturgy and doctrine, procedure and prestige. “God save us,” he exclaims, “from a worldly Church with superficial spiritual and pastoral trappings!” Urging a greater role for the laity, the Pope warns of “excessive clericalism” and calls for “a more incisive female presence in the Church”, especially “where important decisions are made.”Looking beyond the Church, Pope Francis denounces the current economic system as “unjust at its root”, based on a tyranny of the marketplace, in which financial speculation, widespread corruption and tax evasion reign supreme. He also denounces attacks on religious freedom and new persecutions directed against Christians. Noting that secularization has eroded ethical values, producing a sense of disorientation and superficiality, the Pope highlights the importance of marriage and stable family relationships.Returning to his vision of a Church that is poor and for the poor, the Pope urges us to pay particular attention to those on the margins of society, including the homeless, the addicted, refugees, indigenous peoples, the elderly, migrants, victims of trafficking and unborn children. While it is not “progressive” to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life, he says, it’s also true that “we have done little to adequately accompany women in very difficult situations, where abortion appears as a quick solution to their profound anguish.”Finally the new papal document also focuses on the themes of promoting peace, justice and fraternity, through patient and respectful dialogue with all people of all faiths and none. Better relations with other Christians, with Jews and with Muslims are all seen as indispensable ways of promoting peace and combatting fundamentalism. While urging Christians to “avoid hateful generalisations” about Islam, the Pope also calls “humbly” on Islamic countries to guarantee full religious freedom to Christians”“The joy of the Gospel fills the hearts and lives of all who encounter Jesus.” Thus begins the Apostolic Exhortation, by which Pope Francis develops the theme of the proclamation of the Gospel in the contemporary world, drawn from, among other sources, the contribution of the work of the Synod held in the Vatican, from 7 to 28 October 2012, on the theme “The new evangelization for the transmission of the faith”. “I wish to encourage the Christian faithful to embark upon a new chapter of evangelization marked by this joy, while pointing out new paths for the Church’s journey in years to come” (1). It is a heartfelt appeal to all baptized persons to bring Christ’s love to others, “permanently in a state of mission” (25), conquering “the great danger in today’s world”, that of an individualist “desolation and anguish” (2).The Pope invites the reader to “recover the original freshness of the Gospel”, finding “new avenues” and “new paths of creativity”, without enclosing Jesus in “dull categories” (11). There is a need for a “pastoral and missionary conversion, which cannot leave things as they presently are” (25) and a “renewal” of ecclesiastical structures to enable them to become “more mission-oriented” (27). The Pontiff also considers “a conversion of the papacy” to help make this ministry “more faithful to the meaning which Jesus Christ wished to give it and to the present needs of evangelization”. The hope that the Episcopal Conferences might contribute to “the concrete realization of the collegial spirit”, he states, “has not been fully realized” (32). A “sound decentralization” is necessary (16). In this renewal, the Church should not be afraid to re-examine “certain customs not directly connected to the heart of the Gospel, even some of which have deep historical roots” (43).A sign of God’s openness is “that our church doors should always be open” so that those who seek God “will not find a closed door”; “nor should the doors of the sacraments be closed for simply any reason”. The Eucharist “is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak”. These convictions have pastoral consequences that we are called to consider with prudence and boldness” (47). He repeats that he prefers “a Church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church … concerned with being at the centre and then ends by being caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures. If something should rightly disturb us … it is the fact that many of our brothers and sisters are living without … the friendship of Jesus Christ” (49).The Pope indicates the “temptations which affect pastoral workers” (77): “individualism, a crisis of identity and a cooling of fervour” (78). The greatest threat of all is “the grey pragmatism of the daily life of the Church, in which all appears to proceed normally, which in reality faith is wearing down” (83). He warns against “defeatism” (84), urging Christians to be signs of hope (86), bringing about a “revolution of tenderness” (88). It is necessary to seek refuge from the “spirituality of well-being … detached from responsibility for our brothers and sisters” (90) and to vanquish the “spiritual worldliness” that consists of “seeking not the Lord’s glory but human glory and well-being” (93). The Pope speaks of the many who “feel superior to others” because “they remain intransigently faithful to a particular Catholic style from the past” whereby “instead of evangelizing, one analyses and classifies others” (94). And those who have “an ostentatious preoccupation for the liturgy, for doctrine and for the Church’s prestige, but without any concern that the Gospel have a real impact” on the needs of the people (95). This is “a tremendous corruption disguised as a good … God save us from a worldly Church with superficial spiritual and pastoral trappings!” (97).He appeals to ecclesial communities not to fall prey to envy and jealousy: “How many wars take place within the people of God and in our different communities!” (98). “Whom are we going to evangelize if this is the way we act?” (100). He highlights the need to promote the growth of the responsibility of the laity, often kept “away from decision-making” by “an excessive clericalism” (102). He adds that there is a need for “still broader opportunities for a more incisive female presence in the Church”, in particular “in the various settings where important decisions are made” (103). “Demands that the legitimate rights of women be respected … cannot be lightly evaded” (104). The young should “exercise greater leadership” (106). With regard to the scarcity of vocations in many places, he emphasizes that “seminaries cannot accept candidates on the basis of any motivation whatsoever” (107).With regard to the theme of inculturation, he remarks that “Christianity does not have simply one cultural expression” and that the face of the Church is “varied” (116). “We cannot demand that peoples of every continent, in expressing their Christian faith, imitate modes of expression which European nations developed at a particular moment of their history” (118). The Pope reiterates that “underlying popular piety … is an active evangelizing power” (126) and encourages the research of theologians, reminding them however that “the Church and theology exist to evangelize” and urges them not to be “content with a desk-bound theology” (133).He focuses “somewhat meticulously, on the homily”, since “many concerns have been expressed about this important ministry and we cannot simply ignore them” (135). The homily “should be brief and avoid taking on the semblance of a speech or a lecture” (138); it should be a “heart-to-heart communication” and avoid “purely moralistic or doctrinaire” preaching (142). He highlights the importance of preparation: “a preacher who does not prepare is not ‘spiritual’; he is dishonest and irresponsible” (145). Preaching should always be positive in order always to “offer hope” and “does not leave us trapped in negativity” (159). The approach to the proclamation of the Gospel should have positive characteristics: “approachability, readiness for dialogue, patience, a warmth and welcome, which is non-judgmental” (165).In relation to the challenges of the contemporary world, the Pope denounces the current economic system as “unjust at its root” (59). “Such an economy kills” because the law of “the survival of the fittest” prevails. The current culture of the “disposable” has created “something new”: “the excluded are not the ‘exploited’ but the outcast, the ‘leftovers’” (53). “A new tyranny is thus born, invisible and often virtual”, of an “autonomy of the market” in which “financial speculation” and “widespread corruption” and “self-serving tax-evasion reign” (56). He also denounces “attacks on religious freedom” and the “new persecutions directed against Christians. … In many places the problem is more that of widespread indifference and relativism” (61). The family, the Pope continues, “is experiencing a profound cultural crisis”. Reiterating the indispensable contribution of marriage to society” (66), he underlines that “the individualism of our postmodern and globalized era favours a lifestyle which … distorts family bonds” (67).He re-emphasizes “the profound connection between evangelization and human advancement” (178) and the right of pastors “to offer opinions on all that affects people’s lives” (182). “No one can demand that religion should be relegated to the inner sanctum of personal life, without a right to offer an opinion on events affecting society”. He quotes John Paul II, who said that the Church “cannot and must not remain on the sidelines in the fight for justice” (183). “For the Church, the option for the poor is primarily a theological category” rather than a sociological one. “This is why I want a Church that is poor and for the poor. They have much to teach us” (198). “As long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved … no solution will be found for this world’s problems” (202). “Politics, although often denigrated”, he affirms, “remains a lofty vocation and one of the highest forms of charity”. I beg the Lord to grant us more politicians who are genuinely disturbed by … the lives of the poor!” (205). He adds an admonition: “Any Church community”, if it believes it can forget about the poor, runs the risk of “breaking down”.The Pope urges care for the weakest members of society: “the homeless, the addicted, refugees, indigenous peoples, the elderly who are increasingly isolated and abandoned” and migrants, for whom the Pope exhorts “a generous openness” (210). He speaks about the victims of trafficking and new forms of slavery: “This infamous network of crime is now well established in our cities, and many people have blood on their hands as a result of their comfortable and silent complicity” (211). “Doubly poor are those women who endure situations of exclusion, mistreatment and violence” (212). “Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love and concern are unborn children, the most defenceless and innocent among us. Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human dignity” (213). “The Church cannot be expected to change her position on this question … it is not ‘progressive’ to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life” (214). The Pope makes an appeal for respect for all creation: we “are called to watch over and protect the fragile world in which we live” (216).With regard to the theme of peace, the Pope affirms that “a prophetic voice must be raised” against attempts at false reconciliation to “silence or appease” the poor, while others “refuse to renounce their privileges” (218). For the construction of a society “in peace, justice and fraternity” he indicates four principles (221): “Time is greater than space” (222) means working “slowly but surely, without being obsessed with immediate results” (223). “Unity prevails over conflict” (226) means “a diversified and life-giving unity” (228). “Realities are more important than ideas” (231) means avoiding “reducing politics or faith to rhetoric” (232). “The whole is greater than the part” means bringing together “globalization and localization” (234).“Evangelization also involves the path of dialogue,” the Pope continues, which opens the Church to collaboration with all political, social, religious and cultural spheres (238). Ecumenism is “an indispensable path to evangelization”. Mutual enrichment is important: “we can learn so much from one another!” For example “in the dialogue with our Orthodox brothers and sisters, we Catholics have the opportunity to learn more about the meaning of Episcopal collegiality and their experience of synodality” (246); “dialogue and friendship with the children of Israel are part of the life of Jesus’ disciples” (248); “interreligious dialogue”, which must be conducted “clear and joyful in one’s own identity”, is “a necessary condition for peace in the world” and does not obscure evangelization (250-251); in our times, “our relationship with the followers of Islam has taken on great importance” (252). The Pope “humbly” entreats those countries of Islamic tradition to guarantee religious freedom to Christians, also “in light of the freedom which followers of Islam enjoy in Western countries!” “Faced with disconcerting episodes of violent fundamentalism” he urges us to “avoid hateful generalisations, for authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence” (253). And against the attempt to private religions in some contexts, he affirms that “the respect due to the agnostic or non-believing minority should not be arbitrarily imposed in a way that silences the convictions of the believing majority or ignores the wealth of religious traditions” (255). He then repeats the importance of dialogue and alliance between believers and non-believers (257).The final chapter is dedicated to “spirit-filled evangelizers”, who are those who are “fearlessly open to the working of the Holy Spirit” and who have “the courage to proclaim the newness of the Gospel with boldness (parrhesía) in every time and place, even when it meets with opposition” (259). These are “evangelizers who pray and work” (262), in the knowledge that “mission is at once a passion for Jesus and a passion for his people” (268): “Jesus wants us to touch human misery, to touch the suffering flesh of others” (270). He explains: “In our dealings with the world, we are told to give reasons for our hope, but not as an enemy who critiques and condemns” (271). “Only the person who feels happiness in seeking the good of others, in desiring their happiness, can be a missionary” (272); “if I can help at least one person to have a better life, that already justifies the offering of my life” (274). The Pope urges us not to be discouraged before failure or scarce results, since “fruitfulness is often invisible, elusive and unquantifiable”; we must know “only that our commitment is necessary” (279). The exhortation concludes with a prayer to Mary, “Mother of Evangelization”. “There is a Marian ‘style’ to the Church’s work of evangelization. Whenever we look to Mary, we come to believe once again in the revolutionary nature of love and tenderness” (288). ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The article discusses Pope Francis' impact on the Catholic Church and its followers during the first eight months of his pontificate.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   In group A, would the eggs most likely develop outside or inside the mother's body?  All marine creatures are not fish. There are some mammals, for example, whales, also live in the water. Rob wants to know more about differences between fish and other non fish creatures in the water. He divided them into two groups, group A and group B. Group A consists of fish, and group B consists of non fish creatures in the water. He started to see the differences between these two groups.  Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. A:","output":"In group A, the eggs would most likely develop outside the mother's body.

Summarize the following: The spotting or bleeding can be normal, but it may also be a warning sign of complications with the pregnancy, such as a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Additional feelings of pain, fatigue, or dizziness warrant further evaluation by your doctor. Heavy bleeding between your periods, and even during your period, can be an indicator of complications, many of which are easily managed. Contacting your gynecologist is the first step in determining the cause of the heavy bleeding and discovering possible treatment options. Whether you are taking continuous hormone therapy, cyclic hormone therapy, or not taking hormone therapy at all, episodes of unexpected bleeding are not normal. Contact a doctor if unexpected bleeding occurs. The risk of cancer increases by about 10% in postmenopausal women that experience vaginal bleeding. If you go as long as 90 days without having your period, then contact your doctor. Stop using tampons and contact your doctor immediately if you develop a fever, muscle aches, diarrhea or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, an unexplained sunburn-like rash, sore throat, or notice redness in your eyes. Spotting can be caused by conditions or illnesses both unrelated and related to women’s health issues. Either way, your doctor can help to rule out other conditions or illnesses.  The use of certain medications like corticosteroids, blood thinners, and even antidepressants have been linked to episodes of spotting. Thyroid disease and diabetes are also possible contributors to spotting between your periods. Women’s health conditions that may be causing the abnormal bleeding episodes can include uterine fibroids, uterine polyps, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, bladder or vaginal infections, and cancer. Abnormal pap tests and infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia can also cause abnormal spotting. Seek medical attention as soon as possible if you continue to have abnormal bleeding or spotting. Summary:","output":"Spotting or bleeding during pregnancy can be normal or indicate complications such as miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Heavy bleeding between periods may also signal issues.

Answer:","output":"Sir Frederick Adam was born in 1781 in Scotland to William Adam, a Member of Parliament. He began his military career in 1795, serving in the Kingdom of Great Britain's armed forces. Adam was primarily part of the UK artillery branch and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually attaining the rank of General. Throughout his service years, Adam participated in numerous battles, including Peninsular Biar, Ordal War of the Seventh Coalition, and Waterloo War. He played key roles in the victories at the battles of Castalla and Alicante. His strong leadership and tactical prowess earned him the command of the 3rd Light Brigade. In addition to his impressive military career, Adam also held prestigious positions in public service. He was appointed as the Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands and Governor of Madras. His influence extended beyond the battlefield and into the political realm, helping to shape the future of the regions he governed. In 1848, William Salter painted a portrait of Sir Frederick Adam, titled \\"Frederick or After Adam,\\" providing a visual representation of this accomplished figure. Sir Frederick Adam passed away in 1853, leaving behind a legacy of military and political contributions that have left an indelible mark on history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. A colleague of the new prime minister was recently asked to describe his boss's style. \\"She just sits there in cabinet looking exasperated in a poised way.\\" I read this and a light bulb went on. To go through meetings looking exasperated but poised is what we should all be aiming for. It is superior but never rude. It is powerful but not dishonest. It is a bit forbidding. A little regal. It is just perfect. This question of how to arrange your face when you are sitting round a table at work listening to other people talk is important. The average executive spends about four hours a day in meetings, most of which is spent in silence half-listening to the person talking while studying the faces of the people who are not. This suggests we have got it all wrong. We fret about the impression we make when we speak, but spend no time worrying about how we come across when we are silent. The other day I was sent a photo of a panel I had recently been on, taken by someone in the audience. Two of the panellists are looking away from the person talking. Two appear catatonic. I am looking a little mad, with eyes popping in incredulity and a slight smirk around the mouth. Only one of us got it right. He had composed his face into a mask of polite yet sceptical interest. Our meetings faces are too important to be allowed to compose themselves. The most common look in meetings (at least on the faces of those not talking) is boredom, which is never a good look. The vacant slouch creates an air of gormlessness, while the slack muscles make you look ancient and exhausted. Being so bored that you go to sleep is the worst look there is. Kay Whitmore, chief executive of Kodak in the 1990s, was more infamous for falling asleep in a meeting with Bill Gates, than for helping to run his company into the ground. While nodding off is fatal, nodding in general can be excellent. For nine years I sat on the board of a company and so must have spent several hundred hours watching some of the country's finest non-executive directors nod. It turns out there are different sorts of nods that come in handy at different times. The more complex the material under discussion, the more a medium speed nod makes you look clever and on the ball, while a slower 'I'm considering this' nod can also come in handy. Otherwise, the rules for meetings faces are the opposite of the rules for office expressions in general. While smiling is usually a good plan as it makes other people feel better, in meetings it is to be avoided, unless someone has made a joke, as it can make you look unserious, too keen, and possibly sycophantic. Sucking up, though sometimes necessary, is so demeaning it must never be done in public. Frowning, generally bad in offices, is essential in meetings. It implies you are thinking deeply and can distance you from whatever decisions are being taken. Better still it implies superiority: you could do it better yourself. You could say that we are stuck with the expressions we were born with. But that's not true. I have been spending quite a bit of time in front of the mirror being poised and exasperated. It was hard at first, but I've just tried again and, by George, I think I've got it. Lucy Kellaway is an author and Financial Times columnist.

Premise: Much that was said about Japanese management style in the 1980s--with its supposed Zen focus and greater sense of process than outcome--was pure buncombe. Hypothesis: Much of the information about Japanese management was inaccurate. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first analyze the various aspects and characteristics of both statements. Let's break them down step by step. Premise: The statement claims that most of what was commented about Japanese management style in the 1980s was essentially nonsense. It particularly focuses on the following elements of the management style: 1. Zen focus: This suggests that the management style was influenced by Zen Buddhist principles, which typically encourage mindfulness, concentration, and balance in work and life. The premise is arguing that such an association with Zen focus in the Japanese management style was incorrect. 2. Greater sense of process than outcome: This element refers to the belief that the Japanese management style was more concerned with the way things were done rather than the end result. The premise contends that this was a misinformed view. Pure Buncombe: This phrase signifies nonsense or empty talk, implying that the claims about Japanese management style were baseless or misleading. Hypothesis: The hypothesis simply states that much of the information about Japanese management was inaccurate. This statement reflects a general idea about the inaccuracy and misconception surrounding Japanese management practices and styles. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? An entailment, in the context of logical reasoning, means that the truth of a premise ensures the truth of its hypothesis. In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, the premise is very specific, mentioning particular elements of the Japanese management style that were believed to be nonsense or misleading – namely the Zen focus and greater sense of process than outcome. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is more general, implying inaccuracies and misconceptions across various aspects of Japanese management. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is such that if the premise is, indeed, true (i.e., that the highlighted elements of the Japanese management style were baseless or misleading), then it would support the hypothesis that much of the information about Japanese management was inaccurate. Therefore, we can conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis. To elaborate, if it is true that the claims about Zen influence and focus on process over outcome were misconceived or inaccurate, it would support the notion that a considerable portion of information regarding Japanese management styles was indeed flawed or misconstrued."},{"instruction":"The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Article: \\"If you run for more than five minutes at any time, you might need a pair of running shoes.\\" Advises Stephen Pribut, a US sports expert. Running shoes are highly technical footwear. The provide stability  while bearing up to three times the wearer's body weight. But it's not easy to find the right pair. Finding the right running shoes is something of an art, or a science and a feel.       The science part begins with the shape of the arch  of your foot, which anyone can find out at home with this quick experiment: Put your foot in water and place it on a piece of brown paper. If you see a \\"C\\" shape on the paper when you remove your foot, you have a rare high arch. If the shape looks more like a rectangle, that means you have flat feet. See something in between? That's a normal arch.            Conveniently for shoppers, shoe companies nowadays divide their shoes in three categories: neutral ( for high arches), stability ( for normal or low arches) and motion control (for flat arches). So you'll know which type suits you.       At this point, most people would just grab an appealing shoe and try it on, But professionals would do a few quality-control tests. First, you bend the shoe toe to heel to see where it bends. If it's not at the forefoot---where the foot actually be bends, be afraid. Then you grip both ends and twist in opposite directions. If you can twist it like a tower, it means there's zero support. Finally, you squeeze  he heel in both directions. A stable heel won't  _ .       Now you need to check the mold  that shapes the inside of the shoe: whether its wide or narrow in the mid-foot, how it sits on the heel and how roomy the toe box is.       It's wise to make the shoe purchase in the late afternoon, to allow for any swelling  that your feet do throughout the day. Toes also decide sizing choices. The rule is that you need a finger's width from your longest toe (whether that's your big one or not) to the end of the shoe.

The length of a recess can vary depending on the needs, the schedule of the event, and other factors influencing the time management. In some cases, recess can be relatively short, like the 20-minute break mentioned in the text. Short breaks are typically taken to allow participants to refresh themselves, stretch their legs, have a snack, or engage in casual conversations before resuming the main event. However, in other situations, recess can be longer, allowing individuals to have a proper meal, rest, or prepare for the next segment of the event. For instance, a court in session might take a recess of an hour or more for lunch, or a conference could schedule a longer break between presentations or panels. It is also worth noting that the concept of recess can apply to different contexts, like the education sector where students enjoy a break between classes for relaxation and play.

As civil wars engulfed several Central American countries in the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans fled their country and came to the United States. Between 1980 and 1990, the Salvadoran immigrant population in the United States increased nearly fivefold from 94,000 to 465,000. The number of Salvadoran immigrants in the United States continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters that hit El Salvador, including earthquakes and hurricanes. By 2008, there were about 1.1 million Salvadoran immigrants in the United States. Why did Central Americans flee to the U.S.?","output":"Central Americans fled to the U.S. in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s for several reasons: 1. Civil wars: In the 1980s, civil wars engulfed several Central American countries, including El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. These conflicts led to widespread violence, economic disruption, and human rights abuses, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their countries in search of safety and stability. 2. Political instability: The civil wars and their aftermaths also caused political instability in the affected countries, often resulting in weak governments and limited access to essential public services. This further contributed to the motivation to seek refuge in the U.S. 3. Economic hardship: In the wake of these conflicts, Central American countries faced numerous economic challenges and high levels of poverty. This often led to limited job opportunities and a lack of resources, pushing people to seek better economic prospects elsewhere. 4. Family reunification: Many Salvadorans and other Central Americans who had already migrated to the U.S. wanted to bring their family members to join them. Family reunification became a significant driver of continued migration in the 1990s and 2000s. 5. Natural disasters: Central America is prone to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. In the late 1990s and 2000s, a series of devastating disasters hit El Salvador and other countries in the region. The destruction and disruption caused by these events led to even more people emigrating in search of a more stable and secure life. In summary, Central Americans fled to the U.S. due to a combination of factors, including civil wars, political instability, economic hardship, family reunification, and natural disasters. The United States offered the safety, stability, and opportunities that were lacking in their home countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Born in 1820 in Serres, which was part of the Sanjak of Serres in the Salonica Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, he was an Ottoman national and a devout Muslim. Rifat Pasha's career began in 1882 when he was appointed to his first significant post as Mutasarrıf of the Aidin Vilayet. He went on to hold various governorship positions in several provinces, including Manastir Vilayet, Sivas Vilayet, and Vidin, which provided him with invaluable experience in regional administrative roles. Capacities in each territory varied from maintaining order and security to overseeing the implementation of legal, financial, and infrastructural reforms. In 1886, he was promoted to the prestigious position of Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, which was principally the Chief Minister responsible for executing the Sultan's decrees. Throughout his various terms in the role (ending in 1889, 1891, and 1893 respectively), Halil Rifat Pasha collaborated closely with Monarch Abdülhamid II, who ruled the empire from 1876 until 1909. Rifat Pasha's last tenure as Grand Vizier began on 7 November 1895 and continued until his death on 9 November 1901. During this period, the Ottoman Empire confronted significant challenges domestically and internationally. His influence and leadership were essential in navigating internal unrest, diplomatic relations, and managing the empire's response to various crises while in office. Over the course of his career, Halil Rifat Pasha worked alongside various notable figures, including his predecessor Nafiz Pasha Kâmil Pasha and successors Abdurrahman Nurettin Pasha and Mehmed Said Pasha. His multiple terms as Grand Vizier showcased his loyalty to the empire and ability to adapt to changing political circumstances.

This article will delve into the significance of the J1 visa program, its impact on participants, and its benefits for both the Republic of Ireland and the United States. We'll also examine what the extension means for international cultural exchange and how it strengthens the already robust partnership between these two countries. The J1 Visa Program: An Overview: The J1 visa is a non-immigrant, cultural exchange visa issued by the United States, aimed at promoting global understanding and cooperation through educational and cultural exchange programs. Introduced in the 1960s, it allows participants, including students, interns, teachers, researchers, and young professionals, to travel to the U.S. for temporary work or study opportunities.  For the Republic of Ireland, the J1 visa carries particular significance. It has long been viewed as a rite of passage for Irish students looking to gain international experience and exposure to American culture. The visa program has helped thousands of Irish students build their skills, develop a global mindset, and forge invaluable personal and professional connections. Similarly, the United States has benefited from the cultural diversity and fresh perspectives that Irish J1 visa holders bring to various educational and professional fields. The Extension of the J1 Visa Agreement: This recent agreement extends the 12-month J1 visa program for Irish participants for another three years. The announcement has been welcomed by students, business owners, and policymakers alike, who regard the extension as an affirmation of the strong ties between the Republic of Ireland and the United States. The J1 visa extension will enable Irish students and young professionals to continue accessing valuable educational, training, and professional opportunities in the U.S in various industries. The agreement further solidifies the commitment of both nations to strengthen their bonds and facilitate cross-cultural experiences for young people in coming years. Impacts of the J1 Visa Program: The J1 visa program has considerable impacts on both Irish and American participants: 1. Cultural Exchange: The program fosters a better understanding of each other's cultures and customs, challenging stereotypes and nurturing global citizens who appreciate and respect cultural diversity. 2. Professional Development: Participants gain valuable work and educational experiences in the United States, often in their respective fields. This international exposure facilitates not only their professional growth but also broadens their horizons and networks for future cooperation between Ireland and the United States. 3. Economic Impact: The J1 visa program provides a source of seasonal staffing for American businesses, particularly in the tourism and hospitality industries. Irish students often fill temporary job positions in resorts, restaurants, and holiday attractions, contributing positively to local economies. 4. Strengthened Ties: The J1 visa program cements the longstanding partnership between the Republic of Ireland and the United States. It fosters goodwill and understanding between the two nations, laying the foundation for deeper collaboration across various sectors. The Future of the J1 Visa Program: The recent extension of the J1 visa agreement signifies that both the Republic of Ireland and the United States recognize the immense value of this cultural exchange program. The positive impact on Irish students and American businesses will likely continue to be felt for years to come. As these relationships grow, it is crucial for policymakers and program administrators to continue developing and expanding upon the foundations laid by the J1 visa program. By doing so, the possibilities for further cultural, educational, and professional exchange are increased, benefiting not only the individuals involved but also the nations themselves. Conclusion: In today's increasingly interconnected world, cross-cultural understanding is more critical than ever before. The J1 visa program has been, and will continue to be, an essential tool in fostering such understanding and growth. The Republic of Ireland and the United States' decision to extend the program's duration serves as a testament to their shared commitment to nurturing collaborative, open-minded global citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Latin American Boom was a flourishing of literature, poetry and criticism in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, when writers from this region explored new ideas and came to international renown in a way that had not happened previously.

The Latin American Boom happened in 2001 OPT: (1). Yes. (2). It's impossible to say. (3). No.","output":"(3). No.  The Latin American Boom occurred during the 1960s and 1970s, not in 2001. This literary movement saw a remarkable surge in Latin American literature that garnered international attention and acclaim. Renowned authors such as Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Jorge Luis Borges became the defining figures of this movement, exploring innovative narrative styles and themes that transcended geographical, cultural, and political boundaries. One of the key factors that contributed to the Latin American Boom was the region's post-colonial sociopolitical climate. Many countries in Latin America had emerged from the yoke of colonialism and were struggling to establish their identities. Writers of the Boom period addressed these complex issues through their works, highlighting the challenges and perspectives of Latin American societies at the time. Additionally, with the increasing political instability and the rise of dictatorships throughout the region, writers found literary expression as a means to challenge oppressive governments and resist conformity. Another factor that facilitated the Latin American Boom was the accessibility of literature from around the world. During the 1960s and 1970s, Latin American authors had greater access to global works of literature, allowing them to engage in intercultural conversations and incorporate new ideas from both European and North American literary traditions. This exposure to diverse literary genres played a significant role in shaping the narrative styles and creativity found in Latin American Boom literature. These works often embraced magical realism, a style that involves the infusion of fantastical elements into realistic settings, blurring the lines between reality and myth. Gabriel García Márquez's masterpiece, \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" is a prime example of this. The novel narrates the history of the fictional town of Macondo, weaving a rich tapestry of interconnected stories spanning seven generations of the Buendía family. The vivid portrayal of the town's daily life along with the supernatural occurrences that imbue Macondo's world showcases the unique approach of magical realism. Other literary devices that characterized the Latin American Boom included non-linear narrative structures, intertextuality, dark humor, and regional vernacular language. Julio Cortázar's experimental novel \\"Hopscotch\\" invites readers to approach it in a non-sequential manner, breaking the traditional rules of novel-reading. Borges' short stories explored metafiction and explored the nature of reality and literary creation. In conclusion, the Latin American Boom was a significant literary movement that took place during the 1960s and 1970s, not in 2001. It was marked by a resurgence in Latin American literature that introduced innovative narrative styles and garnered international recognition. As a result, renowned authors like Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Jorge Luis Borges emerged, solidifying the importance and impact of Latin American literature on the global stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Douglas Richard Flutie (born October 23, 1962) is a former quarterback in the National Football League (NFL), Canadian Football League (CFL), and United States Football League (USFL). Flutie first rose to prominence during his college football career at Boston College, where he received the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in 1984. His \\"Hail Flutie\\" touchdown pass in a game against Miami on November 23, 1984 (dubbed \\"The Pass\\") is considered among the greatest moments in college football and American sports history. Flutie was selected as the 285th pick in the 11th round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, making him the lowest drafted Heisman Award winner among those who were drafted. Flutie played football for Boston College, the only Division I-A school to recruit him, from 1981 to 1984, and won the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in his senior year (1984). Flutie became the first quarterback to win the Heisman since Pat Sullivan in 1971. Flutie left school as the NCAA's all-time passing yardage leader with 10,579 yards and was a consensus All-American as a senior. He earned Player of the Year awards from UPI, Kodak, The Sporting News, and the Maxwell Football Club. The quarterback coach for Boston College from 1981 - 1983 was Tom Coughlin.  Flutie gained national attention in 1984 when he led the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against the Miami Hurricanes (led by QB Bernie Kosar). The game was nationally televised on CBS the day after Thanksgiving and thus had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45-41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at its own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only 6 seconds remained. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a \\"Hail Mary pass\\" that was caught in the end zone by Gerard Phelan, giving BC a 47-45 win. Flutie won the Heisman trophy a week later, but the voting had finished before the game; Flutie said, however, that \\"without the Hail Mary pass I think I could have been very easily forgotten\\".  The subsequent rise in applications for admission to Boston College after Flutie's \\"Hail Mary\\" gave rise to the admissions phenomenon known as the \\"Flutie Effect\\". This idea essentially states that a winning sports team can increase the recognition value of a school enough to make it more attractive to potential applicants.  In addition to his collegiate athletic achievement, Flutie maintained a distinguished academic record at Boston College. He was a candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship, for which he was named a finalist in 1984. Upon graduating, Flutie won a National Football Foundation post-graduate scholarship.  In November 2008, Flutie was honored by Boston College with a statue of him throwing his famous \\"Hail Mary\\" pass outside of Alumni Stadium. His number, 22, has been retired by the Boston College football program.","output":"The text is about Douglas Richard Flutie, more commonly known as Doug Flutie. He is a former professional football player born on October 23, 1962. Over his career, he played as a quarterback in three major football leagues: the National Football League (NFL), the Canadian Football League (CFL), and the United States Football League (USFL). Doug Flutie initially gained prominence during his college football days at Boston College. His remarkable performance in 1984 earned him the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award. One of the most memorable moments of his college career was his \\"Hail Flutie\\" touchdown pass in a game against Miami on November 23, 1984, which is considered as one of the greatest moments in college football and American sports history. Despite his astounding college career, Flutie was drafted fairly late (the 285th pick in the 11th round) in the 1985 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams. This made him the lowest drafted Heisman Award winner among those who were actually drafted. Nonetheless, he went on to lead an illustrious football career. Flutie’s college football career from 1981 to 1984 was filled with accolades. Alongside his Heisman Trophy, he won the Maxwell Award and was the first quarterback since Pat Sullivan in 1971 to achieve this feat. He left Boston College as the NCAA's all-time passing yardage leader, with 10,579 yards to his name. He also consistently excelled academically, even becoming a finalist for the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship in 1984. His thrilling \\"Hail Mary\\" pass during a game against the Miami Hurricanes gave birth to the \\"Flutie Effect\\". This signifies that successful sports programs can significantly boost a school's visibility and attractiveness to prospective students.

The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health.  Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above.

Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision.

Refinancing comes with fees and increases your interest rate.   Insurance Packing  is the policy of adding unnecessary insurance, such as credit insurance, to your loan.   Bait and Switch  is a tactic used by lenders to offer a set of terms, and then push higher charges right before you sign the paperwork. If your lender tries to change the loan terms on you last minute, don’t fall for it.   Equity Stripping  is when a lender offers you a loan that is solely based on the value of your home and not on your ability to repay. This is an attempt to have you default on your loan and forfeit your property. To avoid this, look at your finances and be sure you can confidently pay each monthly payment. Because your house is being held as the source of collateral, defaulting on a home equity loan can put your home in danger. Before you decide to open either of these types of loans, be sure you can pay the borrowed money back.   Don’t borrow more than you can repay. This is the easiest way to lose your house to a lender. Some home equity loans will punish you for paying ahead of schedule. This means that, even if you are able to pay off your debt earlier than expected, you may not be able to. If there is a distinct possibility of paying your debt ahead of schedule, consider negotiating the prepayment penalties out of the contract. If for some reason you realize you have made a mistake, and less than three days have passed since the contract was signed, you can legally cancel the contract. You have until midnight on the third business day to cancel the transaction, starting on the day you sign the credit contract. You can only cancel if you are using your principal home as collateral. If you decide to cancel, you must tell the lender in writing. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a longer text, like the article you shared. So, here's a summary for you: The article talks about some bad practices by lenders, especially to people with bad credit. They might try to trick you with things like loan flipping, insurance packing, bait and switch, and equity stripping. It's important to not borrow more money than you can pay back and be careful about the loans you choose. If you realize you made a mistake with your loan, you might be able to cancel it within three days."},{"instruction":"Combine facts and answer this: Saïd Taghmaoui's played the role of Saïd in a 1995 French film written by who ?

Information:  - The Wright Stuff is a British television chat show, hosted by Matthew Wright, and airing on Channel 5 each weekday morning from 9:15 to 11:15am. The series characterises itself as \\"Britain's brightest daytime show\\", which \\"gives ordinary people the chance to talk and comment on everything such as news to the social, emotional and even sexual issues back at home\\", as well as featuring \\"showbiz stars and media commentators\\". \\"The Wright Stuff\\" has been nominated as \\"Best Daytime Programme\\" at both the Royal Television Society and the National Television Awards.  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - Edgbaston is a suburban area of Central Birmingham, England. It is curved around the southwest of the city centre. It is bordered by Moseley to the south east and by Smethwick and Winson Green to the north west.  - TV-am was a TV company that broadcast the ITV franchise for breakfast television in the United Kingdom from 1 February 1983 until 31 December 1992. The station was the UK's first national operator of a commercial breakfast television franchise. Its daily broadcasts were between 6 am and 9:25 am.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color).  - BBC London is the BBC English Region producing local radio, television, teletext and online services in London and parts of the surrounding area. Its output includes the daily \\"BBC London News\\" and weekly \\"Sunday Politics\\" on television, the BBC Radio London radio station and local coverage of the London area on BBC Online and BBC Red Button.

Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.  - BBC Radio Berkshire is the BBC Local Radio service for the English county of Berkshire, North Hampshire, and South Oxfordshire. Radio Berkshire broadcasts on 94.6 (Henley-on-Thames), 95.4 (Windsor), 104.1 (Hannington) and 104.4 (Reading) FM from its studios at Caversham Park near Reading.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Pebble Mill Studios was a television studio complex owned by the BBC located in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England. The nine acre site was opened by Princess Anne on 10 November 1971, and in addition to the studios contained two canteens, a post office, gardens, a seven storey office block, and an Outside Broadcasting (OB) base.  - Anne Margaret Diamond (born 8 September 1954) is an English radio and television presenter and journalist.

The version broadcast by the Atlantic Satellite Network (which was owned by Citytv's former parent CHUM Limited, and is now owned by competitor Bell Media) continued to use the brand under licence from Rogers until 2011, when it was re-launched as \\"CTV Morning Live\\" upon its re-branding as CTV Two Atlantic.  - Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Corbishley Owen  (born 1 November 1947) is an English television presenter and newsreader, best known for presenting the breakfast television programme \\"TV-am\\" and the BBC's local news show \\"Midlands Today\\" since 1997. He is also the current chairman of Luton Town Football Club.  - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million.

His marriage to Deanna (Melissa George) is deteriorating, and his daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) suffers from diabetes, requiring expensive medication. Charles's story is being written down by an unidentified man in a prison cell. On a commuter train, Charles encounters an alluring woman named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston). She is a married financial adviser. The two show each other photographs of their respective daughters and begin to talk. A mutual attraction develops, and the two begin meeting frequently. Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and wind up in a seedy hotel. An armed manâlater identified as Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel)âbursts into the hotel room, beats Charles, and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda agree not to report the crime, as they do not want their spouses to learn of the affair. Shortly after, Charles is blackmailed by LaRoche, who threatens to kill his family if he does not pay 20,000, which Charles promptly pays.

Clouzot also directed documentary films, including \\"The Mystery of Picasso\\", which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.  - The 6th Cannes Film Festival was held between April 1529, 1953. The Grand Prize of the Festival went to \\"The Wages of Fear\\" by Henri-Georges Clouzot. The festival opened with \\"Horizons sans fin\\" by Jean Dréville.  - Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term).

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which forest provides more shade?  Near the city of Middleton, there are two forests. The Trine forest is a forest tightly packed with trees. Trine has hardly any large open spaces on the ground. The Jimpy forest, on the other hand, is much more open. It has some large areas in the forest that are perfect for camping or for children to play in due to the lack of trees.  Hint: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from...

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross, c. 1822 - March 10, 1913) was an American abolitionist. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made some thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved people, family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped abolitionist John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry. Tubman was born Araminta \\"Minty\\" Ross to slave parents, Harriet (\\"Rit\\") Green and Ben Ross. Rit was owned by Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large plantation near Blackwater River in Madison, Maryland. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate. Kate Larson records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement, while Jean Humez says \\"the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, but it might have been a year or two later.\\" Catherine Clinton notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. In her Civil War widow's pension records, Tubman claimed she was born in 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she had only a general idea of when she was born.  Modesty, Tubman's maternal grandmother, arrived in the United States on a slave ship from Africa; no information is available about her other ancestors. As a child, Tubman was told that she seemed like an Ashanti person due to her character traits, though no evidence exists to confirm this lineage. Her mother Rit (who may have had a white father) was a cook for the Brodess family. Her father Ben was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson's plantation. They married around 1808 and, according to court records, they had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses.  Rit struggled to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other slaves and free blacks in the community. At one point she confronted her owner about the sale. Finally, Brodess and \\"the Georgia man\\" came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, \\"You are after my son; but the first man that comes into my house, I will split his head open.\\" Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance. What about her dad?","output":"Harriet Tubman's dad was named Ben Ross. He was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on a plantation near Blackwater River in Madison, Maryland.
